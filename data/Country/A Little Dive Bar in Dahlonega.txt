To the bag packed, first love leaver
The heart cracked, double down dreamer
The homesick for grass that's greener
And a slice of Mama's peach pieTo the flat broke, couch cushion gas money
The worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey
Missin' someone all the while runnin'
Gunnin' for the brighter lightsHere's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda nightWe've all got a number we don't wanna drunk dial
And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at puttin' down new rootsHere's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda nightHere's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Meet a girl outside Atlanta
Then when it's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Just singin' along with your drink raised
A pretty little blonde thing's looking your way
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda nightAnd, it's makin' the best of the worst day kinda night
Oooooh, here's to the break ups
It's that kinda night
