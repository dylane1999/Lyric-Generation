As I kneel before you,
As I bow my head in prayer,
Take this day, make it yours
and fill me with your love.Refrain:
Ave Maria,
Gratia plena,
Dominus tecum,
Benedicta tu.
All I have I give you,
Every dream and wish are yours,
Mother of Christ,
Mother of mine, present them to my Lord.(Repeat Refrain)
As I kneel before you,
And I see your smiling face
Ev'ry thought, ev'ry word
Is lost in your embrace.
(Repeat Refrain)
