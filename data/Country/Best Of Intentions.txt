I had big plans for our future
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried making good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the startNow some people think I'm a loser
Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all alongI'd give you a ring and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best laid plan slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentionsI gave you a ring and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do
But my best laid plan slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentionsSo here I am asking forgiveness
And praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted
Girl I know just how lucky I am
Though you deserve so much better
You won't find devotion more true
Cause I've had the best of intentions
Girl, I've had the best of intentions
Yes, I've had the best of intentions loving you
