I move on like a sinner's prayer
Lettin' go like a levee brakes
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Get reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleedMy only friends are pirates
It's just who I am
Well, I'm better as a memory
Than as your manI'm never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way the storm blows through
I never stay but then again I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb outBut I'm honest to a fault
It's just who I am
I'm better as a memory
Than as you manI see you leaning
You're bound to fall
Well, I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer, nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late'Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning then your standin' still
Left holdin' a losing hand
But one day your gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seekin's done
It's just a part of the passing throughRight there in that moment
You'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory, than as your man
Better as a memory, than as your man
