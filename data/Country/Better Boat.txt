I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone....
More than I'd like to, but I'm okay with staying home....
My how the last few months have changed....
I smile a lot more despite the pain.I breathe in, I breathe out.
Got friends and family to call who let me talk about.
What ain't working, what's still hurtin'.......
All the things I feel like cussing out.
Now and then I let it go
Around the waves I can't control.......
I'm learning how to build a better boatI hate waiting, ain't no patience in these hands.
I'm not complaining, sometimes it's hard to change a man.
I think I'm stronger than I was, so I let God do what he does.I breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't working, what's still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussing out
Now and then I let it go
Around the waves I can't control
I'm learning how to build a better boatI breathe in, I breathe out
Got friends to call who let me talk about
What ain't working, what's still hurtin'
All the things I feel like cussing out
Now and then I let it go
Around the waves I can't control
If it's working I don't know
But I can't down, the thing may not flow
But I'm to build a better boat
