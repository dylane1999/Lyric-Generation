Bring me sunshine
in your smile,
Bring me laughter
all the while,
In this world where we live
there should be more hapiness,
So much joy you can give
to each brand new bright tommorow,
Make me happy through the years
never bring me any tears,
Let your arms be as warm
as the sun from up above,
Bring me fun, bring me sunshine, bring me love!Bring me sunshine
