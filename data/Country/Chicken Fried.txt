You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken friedCold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious childAnd know a mother's loveWell it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with meRaise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken friedCold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunriseSee the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's loveI thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ringSalute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken friedCold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's loveGet a little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
