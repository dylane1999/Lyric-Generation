I wake up
Feeling in my soul
I'm livin' someone else's life
I'm turnin' into concrete
Harder than these city streets
Where no one even cares if I'm alive
I gotta get it right
Get it rightChorus:
There's a place that I know
Where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
The place that I know where they all know me
I gotta get back now to the ones who love me
Wrap myself around you, never let you go
There's nothin' in the world that feels like
Coming home
My mind's heavy and I can't sleep
Not even a memory is good enough
To get me through the night
I'm longin' for the real thing
People who know the real me
And all the ways to love me back to life
Mmmm, I gotta get it right
Get it rightRepeat ChorusI know it's only one call away
But it's not the same
I know it's only one call away
But it's not the same
I know it's only one call away
But it's not the same
I know it's only one call away
But it's not the sameRepeat ChorusI'm feeling
Lost in all the madness
I need somewhere to ease my mind
These sidewalks
Filled with different faces
So many places
But there's none like mine
I'm coming home
