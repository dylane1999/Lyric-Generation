Go to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Your momma's gone away
And your daddy's gonna stayGo to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the cornYou're a sweet little baby
You're a sweet little baby
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the babyDon't you weep pretty baby
Don't you weep pretty baby
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another loving babyGo to sleep, little baby
Go to sleep, little baby
You and me and the devil makes three
Don't need no other lovin' babyGo to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Come lay bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever lovin' baby
