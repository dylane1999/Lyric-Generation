Jesus loves the little children
All the children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the worldEverything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day
And everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find the wayThere is none so blind
As He who will not see
We must not close up minds
We must let our thoughts be freeFor every hour that passes by
You know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that people lies
In the eyes of the beholderAnd everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, sing it children
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a wayWe shouldn't care about the length of His hair
Of the color of His skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives withinAnd we're gonna get old again now
Everything is gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to the look on the good side my friend
And spittle in out in your mindAnd everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day, sing it children
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a way, one more timeAnd everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day.
