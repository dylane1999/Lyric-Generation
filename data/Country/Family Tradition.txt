Country music singers
Have always been a real close family,
But lately some of my kinfolks
Have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because
I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family traditionThey get on me and want to know Hank
Why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over
Everybody makes my prediction
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on
An old family traditionI am very proud
Of my daddy's name
All though his kind of music
And mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over
Put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family traditionDon't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk
And some ole slick's trying to give me friction
I'll say leave me alone
I'm singing all night long
It's a family traditionLord I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973.
When that doctor asked me,
Son how did you get in this condition?
I said, hey sawbones,
I'm just carrying on an ole family traditionSo don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Stop and think it over,
Try and put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, its a family tradition!
