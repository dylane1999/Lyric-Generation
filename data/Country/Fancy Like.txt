Ayy
My girl is bangin'
She's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's
Can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty
But every now and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (ayy)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeak-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight
Ayy, that's how we do, how we do, fancy like, oh
Fancy like, oh
Fancy like, oh
Fancy like, oh
Uh, don't need no Tesla (don't need no Tesla) to impress her (to impress her)
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (there she go)
Don't need no mansion (ooh) to get romancin' (woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (slow dancin')
But every now and then when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (that's right)
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top too (gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (styrofoam)
Squeak-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (all the way home)
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight
Ayy, that's how we do, how we do, fancy like
My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keeping some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light radio slows down
Boxed wine and her up-do goes down
Ayy
