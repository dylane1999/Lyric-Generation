From the dusty May sun her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin, my fingers ran with bloodIn the hushing dusk, under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
And strange hunger haunted me, the looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush and felt the trembling handsWhen the last light warms the rocks and the rattlesnakes unfold
The mountain cats will come to drag away your bones
And rise with me forever across the silent sand
And the stars will be your eyes and the wind will be my hands
