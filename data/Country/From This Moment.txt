From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment onFrom this moment, I have been blessed
I live only, for your happiness
And for your love, I give my last breath
From this moment onI give my hand to you with all my heartI can't wait to live my life with you I can't wait to start
You and I will never be apartMy dreams came true because of you
From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing, I wouldn't giveFrom this moment on
You're the reason I believe in loveAnd you're the answer to my prayers from up aboveAll we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment
As long as I live, I will love you
I promise you this
There is nothing, I wouldn't give
From this moment, I will love you
As long as I live from this moment on
