I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but,
I got a hard rush
It's not slowing down
I got it real bad
I want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's giving you nowI want to taste her lips
Yeah, cuz they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfumeI want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, cuz maybe then
You'd want me just as muchI've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peaceThinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whispering
The way that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried,
I can't get her off my mindI want to taste her lips
Yeah, cuz they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, cuz maybe then
You'd want me just as muchI've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a hard rush,
It's not slowing down
