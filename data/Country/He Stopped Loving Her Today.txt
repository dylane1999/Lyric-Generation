He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th I went to see my
friend today may be found saying I went to see him just today)
