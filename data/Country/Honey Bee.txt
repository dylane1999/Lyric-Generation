Girl I been thinkin' 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
But these feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me
But I'll do my bestYou'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey beeYeah that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smilin' honey right back at me
Now hold on 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just havin' fun
But seriouslyYou'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey beeYour kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothin' left to do but fall in each other's arms
I could've said a "I love you"
Could've wrote you a line or two
Baby all I know to do
Is speak right from the heartYou'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey beeYou'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You be my little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You be my sugar baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
I'll be your honey bee
