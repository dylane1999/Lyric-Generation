You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
Childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kindGo to church cause your mama says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be a waste of time
Always stay humble and kindHold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal don't cheat and don't lie
I know you got moutains to climb but
Always stay humble and kindWhen the dreams you're dreamin come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kindDon't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kindKnow the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
"I love you" ain't no pick up line so
Always stay humble and kindHold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal don't cheat and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb but
Always stay humble and kindWhen those dreams you're dreamin come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride but
Always stay humble and kind
When it's hot eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the A/C and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kindDon't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're goin'
Don't forget turn back around
Help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind
