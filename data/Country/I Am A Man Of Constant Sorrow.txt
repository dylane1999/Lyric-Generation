In constant sorrow through his daysI am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was born and raisedThe place where he was born and raisedFor six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasures here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me nowHe has no friends to help him nowIt's fare thee well my old lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this trainPerhaps he'll die upon this trainYou can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my graveWhile he is sleeping in his graveMaybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shoreHe'll meet you on God's golden shore
