I just want to thank You, Lord, for every time You heard me pray
I just want to thank You, for always being there
When I was so down and out,
You came along, made me want to shout
I just want to thank You, Lord, Thank You, Lord.If I had a thousand lives to live, I'd give them all to my Lord
He's been so good to me, that is the least I could afford
He's made the good times out number the bad,
He's been the best friend I've ever had
I just want to thank You, Lord, Thank You, Lord.Spoken Verse:
I just want to thank You, Lord, for every time that You've heard me,
when I prayed
And I want to thank You, for always being there
I've been down and out, but You've always been right there beside me
And there have been times, Lord, when You were the only friend,
only friend I had
So, I want to take just a minute to praise YouI just want to thank You, Lord, for every time You heard me pray
I just want to thank You, for always being there
When I was so down and out, You came along, and made me want to shout
I just want to thank You, Lord, Thank You, Lord.
