Every time our eyes meet, there is a feelin' inside me
Its almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me, I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
Ive never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreamsI dunno how you do, what you do, Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, baby, Im amazed by youThe smell of your skin, the taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark, your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me, you touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time, every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyesI dunno how you do, what you do, Im so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, baby, Im amazed by youEvery little thing that you do, Every little thing that you do, I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better, I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side, for ever and ever
Every little thing that you do, every little thing that you doBaby, I'm amazed by you
