Many, many years ago when I was 23
I was married to a widow who was pretty as can beThis widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her and soon they too were wedThis made my dad my son-in-law and really changed my life
For now my daughter was my mother 'cause she was my father's wifeAnd to complicate the matter even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boyMy little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so he became my uncle though it mad me very sadFor if he were my uncle that would also made him brother
Of the widows grown-up daughter who was of course my stepmotherFather's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild for he was my daughter's sonMy wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue
Because although she is my wife she's my grandmother twoNow if my wife is my grandmother then I'm her grandchild
And every time I think of it, nearly drives me wild'Cause now I have become the strangest case you ever saw
As husband of my grandmother I am my own grandpawOh I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
It sounds funny I know but it really is so
I'm my own grandpaw
(Listen to this now)
I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
