I wouldn't mind being alone
I wouldn't keep checking my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losing sleep
Remembering everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doing lately
You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby I could let go
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been

It should be something I can do (I could do

I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in
Yeah, you
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
Oh, if I didn't love you
It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do
If I didn't love you
Oh, if I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you (Yeah
If I didn't love you
Oh, if I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
