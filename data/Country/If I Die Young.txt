If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love songUh oh uh ohLord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her babyThe sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough timeIf I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love songThe sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough timeAnd I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger, I've never known the lovin' of a man,
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed byThe sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough timeSo put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollarThey're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh (uh oh)The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em ohThe sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough timeSo put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
