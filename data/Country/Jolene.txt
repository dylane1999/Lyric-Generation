Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you canYour beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald greenYour smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, JoleneHe talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, JoleneBut I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you canYou could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, JoleneI had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene
