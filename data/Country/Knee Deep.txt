Gonna put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues awayHad sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better wayWishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradiseWrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody gonna miss me anywayMind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go awayCause now im knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradiseThis champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change you're geography
Maybe you might beKnee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradiseCome on in the water it's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack of lies
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise
