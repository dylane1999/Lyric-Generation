Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today. YeahLife is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night longThrough all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the handsFrom Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lightsKnock me down and back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely manThere's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivorsLife is a highway

A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooooo Yeah!There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors
