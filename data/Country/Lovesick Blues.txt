I got a feelin' called the blues - oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh - oh lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Well lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick bluesWell I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say:I got a feelin' called the blues - oh lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh - oh lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Well lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues
