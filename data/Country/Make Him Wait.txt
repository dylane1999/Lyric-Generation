When he calls you, you don't have to answer right away
make him wait
And when he small talks before he asks you on a date
Make him wait
When his Pontiac's in the driveway and his eyes are midnight blue
Take a deep breath, do the opposite of what you wanna doMake him wait, by the phone
At the door to meet your dad.
Before that first kiss, he's gotta hold your handYou can't get it back when you give yourself away
Yeah boys gonna run but a real man's gonna stay.
Girl, make him wait
Mmhmmmm, make him wait.And when he says that, it'd be easier if you just stayed the night
Make him wait. (Mmhmmmm).
Your gonna wanna, if you think you just might
Make him wait, oooohhhhMake him wait, by the phone
At the door to meet your dad.
Before that first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand.
You can't get it back when you give yourself away
Yeah boys gonna run but a real man's gonna stay
Girl, Make him wait
Oohhhhh, make him wait.They taught me that love is worth the weight in gold
Like that ring on your hand, so
When you find the one that stays and calls
Then he won't mind
If you make him wait, in his Tux
Cellos sing you down the aisle
Walk slow, take your time
While your daddy cries, and your momma smiles
And they're throwin' rice into the air
And those tin cans roll away
And you look into his eyes, and realize
it's worth the while
to make him wait
Make him wait.
