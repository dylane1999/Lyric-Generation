Got to hold on easy as I let you go,
gonna tell you how much I love,
though you think you already know,
I remeber I thought you looked like an angel,
wrapped in pink so soft and warm,
you had me wrapped around your finger,
since the day you were born.You beautiful baby from the outside in,
Chase your dreams but always know the road
that'll lead you home again,
Go on, take on this whole world,
But to me you know you'll always be,
My Little GirlWhen you were in trouble that crooked little smile,
could melt my heart of stone,
Now look at you, I've turned around,
and you've almost grown,
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper "I Love You!",
in the moonlight at your door,
As I walk away, I hear you say,
"Daddy Love You More!".You're beautiful baby from the outside in.
Chase your dreams but always know the road,
that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world.
But to me you know you'll always be,
my little girl.Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand.
But I won't say "yes" to him unless I know, he's the half
that makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man.
I know he'll say that he's in love.
But between you and me. He won't be good enough!You're beautiful baby from the outside in.
Chase your dreams but always know the road
that'll lead you home again.
Go on, take on this whole world.
But to me you know you'll always be,
my little girl!
