Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I can't fight it anymoreAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the timeIt's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now---
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the doorWishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mindFor me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how I can do withoutI just need you now---(Whoa-whoa)
---
Guess I rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call
But I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh, baby, I need you now
