Oh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Well I've been away from you too long
And all my days have turned to darkness
And I believe my heart has turned to stoneOh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Now I don't say anything at all
Well God don't listen to the noise
Now I'm left here all aloneOoh, oh, I hear what the neighbors say
That that poor boy has lost his way
And I let the others prayOh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
Now I do my talking with a gun
And blood will spill into the gutters
And it will stain the morning sunOoh, oh tell me what the hell I've done
Can I stop at one?
Or have I just begun?Take out the bodies that live
Oh, Lord, it gets me high
I think I'm gonna get my fill
Of taking livesOh, Lord, I don't wanna let my baby down
Well I just wanna give us something one of a kindOh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
I've been a stray from you too long
And all my days have turned to darkness
Hell is leaving the light onAnd ooh, oh they'll hang me way up high
God himself will drop me from the sky
And let me swing a whileOh darlin, darlin
What have I done?
What have I done?
