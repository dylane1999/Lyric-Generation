On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road againGoin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see againAnd I can't wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our wayAnd our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road againOn the road againLike a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friendsAnd I can't wait to get on the road again
And I can't wait to get on the road again
