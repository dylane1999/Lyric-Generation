She works in a bank and she works in a store
And she don't go for that old stuff anymore
She likes to get high and listen to the band
She likes to make love to her kind of man
These outlaw women first of their kind outlaw women they got you right on time
Outlaw women don't need any guns outlaw women just out of funIn a way she's a lot like me she don't give a damn bout society
Might be little rich girl she might be poor
Might be a married woman that needs a little more
Yeah she's a outlaw woman first of the kind
These outlaw women ridin' high in seventy-nine
These outlaw women don't need any guns these outlaw women just out of fun
