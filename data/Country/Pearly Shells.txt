Pearly Shells, from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering up the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you,
More than all the little pearly shellsFor every grain of sand upon the beach
I got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over
For each star
That twinkles in the blue
Pearly shells, from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering up the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shellsFor every grain of sand upon the beach
I've got a kiss for you
And I've got more left over
For each star
That twinkles in the blue
Pearly shells, from the ocean
Shining in the sun
Covering up the shore
When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you
More than all the little pearly shells
More than all the little pearly shells
