Girl you know I've know you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up when I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is overThere's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it trueWell I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk aboutThere's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it-
Make it true?
What d'you say we make it true?
Come on over here
Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going round
