He looked down into her brown eyes and said,? Say a prayer for me?
She threw her arms around him whispered,? God will keep us free?
They could hear the riders coming he said, "This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas they won't take me back alive"There were seven Spanish angels at the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers in the valley of the guns
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels took another angel homeShe reached down and picked the gun up that lay smokin' in his hand
She said,? Father please forgive me I can't make it without my man?
And she knew the gun was empty and she knew she couldn't win
But her final prayer was answered when the rifles fired againThere were seven Spanish angels at the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers in the valley of the guns
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels took another angel homeThere were seven Spanish angels at the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers in the valley of the guns
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels took another angel home
Alright John help me nowThere were seven Spanish angels at the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers in the valley of the guns
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels took another angel home
