Well I'm shamemeless when it comes to loving you
I'll do anything you want me to
I'll do anything at allAnd I'm standing here for all the world to see
Oh baby that's what's left of me
Don't have very far to fallYou know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfiedI'm shameless, oh honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there
I go down upon my kneesAnd I'm changin' swore I'd never compromise
Oh but you convinced me otherwise
I'll do anything you pleaseYou see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from youI have never let anything have this much control over me
I work too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now I can't refuse
I've never had so much to lose
Oh I'm shamelessYou know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like thisIt's out of my hands
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow
So I got to let it goOh I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You make a total fool of me
I just wanted to you to knowOh I'm shameless
I just wanted you to know
Oh I'm shameless
Oh I'm down on my knees... shameless
