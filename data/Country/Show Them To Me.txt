Oh it seems to me this whole world's gone crazy
There's too much hate and killin goin on
But when I see the bare chest of a woman
My worrys and my problems are all gone
No one thinks of fightin, when they see a topless girl
Baby if you would show yours too, we could save the worldShow them to me, show them to me
Unclasp your bra and set those puppies free
They'd look a whole lot better without that sweater baby I'm sure you'll agree
If you got, two fun bags,
Show them to meI don't care if they don't match or ones bigger than the other
You could show me one, and I'll imagine the other
Even if you're really old, theres nothing wrong
Don't be sad your boobs ain't bad, they're just a little longShow them to me, show them to me
Lift up your shirt and let the whole world see
Just disrobe, show your globes and a happy man I'll be
If you got, dos chichi's,
Show them to meI've met a lot of them, but never one I've hated
Even if you've had thirteen kids and you think they look deflated
Theres no such thing as a bad breast, I believe this much is true
If you're a big fat man I'm a titty fan and I'd love to see yours tooooShow them to me, show them to me 
Just like the girls gone wild on T.V.
Just lean back and show your rack and I'll be in ecstasy
If you got two casabas
Show them to meAll the world will live in harmony
It'll do you good, it'll give me wood, we'll make history
If you love your country, I'm gonna say it one more time,
I said if you love your country yea
Then stand your ass up and show them big old titties to me
