The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find
It's true the road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with youIt's like one, two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can beWe used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history; an epiphany
That all we need is usIt's like one, two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin' love, make a lot out of a little
Its just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
Its just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can beAin't no need to complicate it, we both know thats overrated
We've been there, its safe to say it ain't our style, yeah
It's like one, two three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, its safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin' love, make a lot out of a little
Its just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
Its just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
Its just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
Its just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
