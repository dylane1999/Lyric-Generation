Said you wanna stand there,
With your arms around me...
But I can't feel you...
It's kinda like a dream...Then you walk out with another.
Lord my jaw hits the floor...
It's kinda like a dream...Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil,
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...Yeah I waste my time...
And I waste my money...
On a broken dream...
'Cause you wouldn't wear my ring...
Baby give me back my ring...One day you'll look back...
Baby when you're all alone...
Just wonderin' to yourself...
Just where in the hell did I have gone...
And I'll be down the road
Like a thousand times before...
And you'll be sittin' home...
With your jaw on the floor...Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil,
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...Yeah I waste my time...
And I waste my money...
On a broken dream...
'Cause you wouldn't wear my ring...
Baby give me back my ring...Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil,
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...Said little angel with the bottle...
I don't love you anymore...
Yeah I spent some time out with the devil,
Oh but you don't hurt me anymore...
