I don't wanna ask too much or be to bold
And I don't want to weigh you down with a heavy load
I've heard you say that you can handle anything
What I really need to knowIs would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for meI don't need a magic night to make me feel
Like I'm living in a fairy tale
I know this love is real
Hear me when I say whenever I'm away
My heart is with you all the sameWould you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for meLooking back at where we've been
Being scared to let you in
You becoming my best friend
No matter where I travel to
I'm coming right back home to you
If you just wait for meWould you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for meWould you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
