Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understandI've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your manThere's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our timeCome a little closer
Lets go over
What I had in mindBaby lock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understandI've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your manAin't nobody
Ever love nobody
The way that I love youWe're alone now
You don't know how
Long I've wanted toLock the door and turn the lights down low
Put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understandI've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your manI Can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
