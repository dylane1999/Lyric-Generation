The night has a thousand eyes
He's got the sharpest knife
But I've got a thousand lives

I've got a thousand lives
And you are just one of mine
This cat gives me an extra nine

Speak louder
Godfather
You want what's mine
So show your face

Strike harder
You know what's mine
You want what's mine
I saw you

Cat burglar
So come inside
And show your face
To me

The night has a thousand eyes
You are just one of mine
I've got the eagle's sight

Come inside
Come inside
Come inside
Come inside
