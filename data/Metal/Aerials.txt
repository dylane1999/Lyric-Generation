Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fallSwimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go
But you never wanna stayWe are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play
But you never wanna loseAerials
In the sky
When you lose small mind you free your lifeLife is a waterfall
We drink from the river
Then we turn around and put up our wallsSwimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go
But you never wanna stayWe are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play
But you never wanna loseOOOOH!Aerials
