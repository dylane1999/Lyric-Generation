winter falls and out of fuel we hide inside our shell
no excuse or advice, it's just the way we feel

we will stumble through our days
I will read you happy tales
I will catch you if you fall

no surprise to wrap around my iron safety belt
maybe we can try some more, yes, I think we really can

we will stumble through our days
I will read you happy tales
I will catch you if you fall
it's all wrong

winter falls and out of fuel we hide inside ourselves
and never come back out again
