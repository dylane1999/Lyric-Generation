I scream as life crumbles down around me 
A force so obscene 
Your efforts to save us end in vain. 

At the balance we arrive 
The weak are sacrificed 
You kill them as they sleep 
And watch the others weep 
All alone 
You do as youâre told 
You kill so carelessly 

The road to your perfect world is paved 
On suffering and unmarked mass graves 
Signal the apocalypse 

If one is a coward, or if one is brave 
Both die as they tremble when the curtain is raised 
Signal the apocalypse 

(They) command 
(And) conjure it 
Conjure the apocalypse 

I scream as life crumbles down around me 
A force so obscene 
Your efforts to save us end in vain
