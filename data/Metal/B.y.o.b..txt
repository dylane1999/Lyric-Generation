You!Why d'they always send the poor?Barbarisms by Barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious, victories kneel
For brand new spankin' dealsMarching forward hypocriticAnd hypnotic computers
You depend on our protectionYet you feed us lies from the tableclothLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, oooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good timeDancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshineKneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses's dry mouthBreaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangers sitting dripped in oil
Crying freedomHanded to obsoletionStill you feed us lies from the tableclothLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, oooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good timeDancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshineBlast offIt's party timeAnd we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast offIt's party time
And where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangers sitting dripped in oil
Crying "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, oooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
