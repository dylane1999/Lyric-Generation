I'm building a spaceship in my backyard
Using pieces of our family car
I'm building this spaceship out of this car
So I can fly off and live among the stars
I'm gonna bail out before it's too late
Get the fuck out, I'll dwell in space
I'll travel around at the speed of light
Enveloped by the darkness of eternal night
Discover the universe while you all die
I've got a future, so I say goodbye
I want to see what's never been seen
I want to do what's never been done
So I'm building a spaceship black, sleek and fast
I'll fly out of here, ride out on the blast
Split this pit before it blows
I'll watch it from the back seat
One last sick show
