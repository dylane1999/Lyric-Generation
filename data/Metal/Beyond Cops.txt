Full force assault,
With my arsenal,
Of destruction,

Seeing the neighborhood,
With a horrid stare,
Blasting authority,

You will never catch me,
On my killing spree,
Appetite for death,
Realize there is no God.

Ripping the crowd apart,
With my guns ablaze

Making sure i don't miss
Numbers rise of casualties,

Shooting innocent bystanders,
Not giving a fuck,

Stealing the hot MontÃ© then,
An off-road truck,

Driving over bodies,
Gettinâ high on death,
Evading the scene,
I haven't been caught yet,

Keeping my soul,
Cold as ice,
Shredding people to ribbons,
With my weapons,

It's my mission,
To take life,
Mugging citizens of their souls,
When I kill,

There are no rules,
No one is safe,
With me on the loose,
The cops scream,

âfreeze, your under arrestâ,
But my unholy-ammo,
Will go straight through their vests,
And right into their chests,

Chambers of hot lead,
Straight to their heads,
Eating bullets from every direction,
Every second I live,

I defy God,
Reloading my guns,
In the name of Satan,

Killing everything I see,
All insight
But for tonight,
Iâm beyond cops,
And now all will know.
