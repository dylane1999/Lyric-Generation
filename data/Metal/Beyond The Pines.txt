In a place beyond the pines,
Where this tale begun
Rests an evil creature now,
He's both dead and alive

A former looter, rotten inside
Satisfied by the pain he causes, he lives on the other side

An envious soul
Unending hunger
Endless greed
A morbid white

Comes out from his grave in the form of smoke,
Changes shape and chasing looters
Drives you into insanity, blood is his water
Climbs down into rich men's graves, and keeps them as his own
You can run but you can't hide, he seems immortal

He's bound to darkness,
Don't want to see the light
Strives for flesh

Whether he walks, whether he runs
You can run but not hide

In a place beyond the pines,
Where this tale begun
Rests an evil spirit now,
He's both dead and alive

He's immune to the most but can be defeated
Drive a pole through his heart, so he gets stuck
Then you burn him, to ash
Spread him, into the sea

Comes out from his grave in the form of smoke,
Changes shape and chasing looters
Drives you into insanity, blood is his water
Climbs down into rich men's graves, and keeps them as his own
You can run but you can't hide, he seems immortal
