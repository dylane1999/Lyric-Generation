Time to shed my skin, It's time to shed my skin. 
The shrines we built we must transcend. It's time to shed my skin.
Hang it from the trees, hanging from the trees. 
Their arms reach out and haunt the streams. 
Hanging from the trees. 
Burning like a bonfire until there's nothing left. 
I'm losing my desire to be in love with death. 
Leave it all behind, I leave it all behind. 
For the slow kiss of the lashing tides. I'd leave it all behind. 
That's where it ends, that's where it ends. 
Handcuffs and hospital beds, that's where it ends. 
Burning like a bonfire until there's nothing left. 
I'm losing my desire to be in love with death. 
Burning like a bonfire until there's nothing left. 
I'm losing my desire to be in love with death. 
The snake eats its tail, the snake eats its tail. 
It's silent and slow behind the veil. 
The snake eats its tail, the snake eats its tail. 
The snake eats its tail. It's silent and slow behind the veil. 
The snake eats its tail. Burning like a bonfire until there's nothing left.
I'm losing my desire to be in love with death. 
Burning like a bonfire until there's nothing left. 
I'm losing my desire to Be in love with death.
