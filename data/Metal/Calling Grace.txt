In the dark
Captured in his frozen heart
Colours fade into grey
She tried so hard
Every word was torn apart
Shot her down with poisoned dartsHer tears made her swim beneath the sea
She's freeCalling grace
She'll never fall again
Love remains in herSoftly, her inner voice has learned to speak
Following her dreamsHer tears made her swim beneath the sea
She's freeCalling grace
She'll never fall again
Love remains in herCalling grace
She will rise again
Sacrifice the saints
Still love remains...
