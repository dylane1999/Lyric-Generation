Friday night I was feeling blue
You wouldn't let me do
What I wanted to do
Looking fine in your nasty dress
Brought on all my manliness
You said we could do it
Made me wait so long
Why'd you change your mind
Change your mind
It ain't so wrong, no

She said, What's your hurry
We've got lots of time
Don't push, don't rush
Don't hand me a line
But when you play with something nice
Don't be that way with me
Make it last, don't move so fast
That's how it's got to be

Baby who's calling the shots
I thought it was me (ha)
I guess it's not
Baby who's calling the shots
I wanna know
Cause baby I'm hot
I'm calling the shots
Shoot me

Closer, closer move a little closer
Boys like me don't bite
Cause if you do
I'm going to make my move
Well I'll keep it up all night
We can toss, we can touch
All that one on one
Get the lead out, get the lead out
With my loaded gun

Baby who's calling the shots
I thought it was me (ha)
I guess I'm not
Baby who's calling the shots
I wanna know
Cause baby I'm not
Who's calling the shots

Oh
Who's who's who's who's
Whoooo's
Calling calling the shots
I wish I was one time
I gotta get some
I'll take you, ow
Babe baby babe baby
Oh oh oh oh

Closer, closer come a little bit closer
This boy he, he won't bit
Closer, closer a little bit closer
Change your mind, change your mind
I'll keep it up all night

Baby who's calling the shots
Thought it was me
I guess it's not
Baby who's calling the shots
I wanna know
Cause baby I'm hot

Baby who's calling the shots
I wanna know
Cause baby I'm hot
I'm hot
I'm calling the shots
