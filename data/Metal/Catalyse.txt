Connect to me,
The time has come for this.
Cure me
Catalyse me, high!

Higher and higherâ¦

We are endlessly aiming to break free
Dying to make our stand!

A faÃ§ade on display demanding bows
While taking all from people afar
You see yourself as a warrior praised
When all you do is sit and wait
Forgetting youâre a part of it all
Dismissing all the mirrors that are in your way

Allow your mind to flyâ¦

Loneliness
To you, itâs just the same
Watching us, from above
When earthâs gone youâre on your way to the sky
Sky
Why?

Stand up!
And reveal yourself!

Higher and higherâ¦
High and high

If you donât break these chains
We both wonât see the dawn of another day
