Going take the northern line
and leave the ghost of us behind
Cause' I refused to turn back time
I don't want to change the world, IAnd I take a change we are use to stay
remember the smile and remember everyday
Now I am fallin
Ya I am fallin
Spoken aloud and I screaming your name
Both the clothes and I drinking a game
But I am fallin
You were callingI'm picked up the phone and wanna hear your voice
I don't even wanna be your lover and wanna feel your lover
And all moments here hold onAnd everything I used to give it to you try
These are blond and I don't know why
Your eyes are dry
Let's travel againSo going take the northern line
And leave the ghost of us behind
Cause' I refused to turn back time
Oh I don't wanna changethe world, I
Just wanna change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind
Oh I don't wanna change ...
Just wanna change your mindStill given the all but the journey is hard
Low sick no start a suck
But I'm crawlin
Ya I'm fallinAnd I knockin on your door
Had just one you feel the touch
Yeah you know what give it up
The memorie of us to love us on a chainI'm gonna take your eyes and made them si
That Everything your eyes
Everything I need
When the lights come down on these empty streets
I want leave you home
If you wait for meSo going take the northern line
and leave the ghost of us behind
Cause' I refused to turn back time
No I don't want a changethe world, I
So going take the fiftynine
and leave my heart to even wine
Cause' I one faid the stars aline
Oh I don't wanna changethe world, I
Just wanna change your mjnd
Change your mind

No I don't wanna changethe world, I
Just wanna change your mind
