Got a choke neck
Ain't a thing to respect
So say it ain't over
Say it ain't over

The blood is blunt
Give a guy some room
And say it ain't over
Say it ain't over

Get thick
Choke neck
Really get thick
Choke neck

Like a toothpick
Or a chopstick
Get thick
Choke neck

Found my treasure chest
Giving you the rest
Say it ain't over
Say it ain't over

And the tide is low
But the grip has grown
Say it ain't over
Say it ain't over

Get thick
Choke neck
Really get thick
Choke neck

Like a toothpick
Or a chopstick
Get thick
Choke neck

Say it enough times
And you might rhyme
Grant your wish
And look delish

Just give a shout
And choke me out
Say it ain't over
Say it ain't over

Just give a shout
And choke me out
Say it ain't over
Say it ain't over

Say it enough times
And you might rhyme
