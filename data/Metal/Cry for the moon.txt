Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and ever
Indoctrinated minds so very often
contain sick thoughts
And commit most of the evil they preach against
Don't try to convince me with messages from God
You accuse us of sins committed by yourselvesIt's easy to condemn without looking in the mirror
Behind the scenes opens reality
Eternal silence cries out for justiceForgiveness is not for saleNor is the will to forget
Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourself
behind a fairytale forever and everOnly by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and everVirginity has been stolen at very young ages
And the extinguisher loses it's immunity
Morbid abuse of power in the garden of Eden
Where the apple gets a youthful face
Eternal silence cries out for justiceForgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
Follow your common sense
You cannot hide yourselfbehind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
Forever and ever
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale
Nor is the will to forget
You can't go on hiding yourself
Behind old fashioned fairytales
And keep washing your hands in innocence
