You know how much a woman woman feels
Come and turn me turn me turn me round!
Hold me and carry me on fire
And let us be as one...

Kiss me!
Feel me now!

Happy in my demons' arms I'm
Dancing fire is all around

I don't fear to follow follow you
Guide me to free me free me free me now!
Your heart is cold and though it burns
As bright as thousand stars

Kiss me!
Feel me now!

Happy in my demons' arms I'm
Dancing fire is all around
Carry me out of this world
(To) where dancing fire is all around

Happy in my demons' arms I'm
Dancing fire is all around
Carry me out of this world
(To) where dancing fire is all around
