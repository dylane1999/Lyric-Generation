You tell me I need it
Assure there is no life without it
Everything's gonna be different
Now I'm leaving, I'm descending

Broken is my only company
Masterwork's now incomplete
This chaotic state will last
Can you see it, just react

Once again I realize
I'm too patient - blessing in disguise
Or it's curse I'm really not sure
I've decided, I will face me

Broken closed my only destiny
In the several lines i can see
Travelling heads but still I can feel
No more patient, no more win

Broken closed my only destiny
In the several lines i can see
Travelling heads but still I can feel
No more patient, no more win

Broken will is now my only company
Masterwork's now incomplete
This chaotic state will last
Can you see it, just react
Broken is my only company
Masterwork's now incomplete
This chaotic state will last
Can you see it, just react
