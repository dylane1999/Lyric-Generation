On a Mountain we stand, look all over the Land
To the Fields we have conquered with Blood
When the Time comes to ride to defend our Pride
To run into their Horde with a thud

We all live our Lfes without Sorrow and Strife
But when we are hearing the Call
Leave our Children and Wifes, our belongings behind
To win for the Freedom or Fall

When we live in the Peacetime, our Songs for Glory we sing
But when we die in the Battle, we die like Kings
Against the Flame of Destruction, whatever Evil may bring
when we die in the Fire, we die like Kings
Ohohohohoh Die like Kings
Ohohohohoh Die like Kings
Ohohohohoh ohohoh
Ohohohohohoho
Die like Kings

There's a Storm in the Sky, now all Rebels unite
Let us combat for Freedom and March
We're the Young and the Free, at the End they will see
That true Heroes have Pride in their Hearts

Cross the Wasteland we roll, shoot the Iron Crossbow
Broke Silence with Rockets and Guns
If we die in the field, we at least did not yield
Like Kings we stopped being on the Run

When we live in the Peacetime, our Songs for Glory we sing
But when we die in the Battle, we die like Kings
Against the Flame of Destruction, whatever Evil may bring
when we die in the Fire, we die like Kings
Ohohohohoh Die like Kings
Ohohohohoh Die like Kings
Ohohohohoh ohohoh
Ohohohohohoho
Die like Kings

A rebeelious call we have heard it all
Whatever Darkness brings
For the Young and Wild we shall win or die
Far above the Eagle sings
Die like Kings

When we live in the Peacetime, our Songs for Glory we sing
But when we die in the Battle, we die like Kings
Against the Flame of Destruction, whatever Evil may bring
when we die in the Fire, we die like Kings
Ohohohohoh Die like Kings
Ohohohohoh Die like Kings
Ohohohohoh ohohoh
Ohohohohohoho
Die like Kings
