Forces of the northern light, assemble
Forces of the northern night, call to arms
Summoned by the secrets of sacrificeDimmu BorgirMeeting destiny on the road
We took to avoid it
As we only compete with ourselves
Left is that of a confident unionDimmu BorgirWhat bridge to cross
And what bridge to burn
Deceit is everywhere you turn
We weed out the weak and their weepDimmu BorgirEvolving compulsively
Behaving inconsistently
Yet the pulse is pounding
Restoration is the name
For those who are left in the game
Invocation in the name of our flameDimmu Borgir
The deviants seek but one place
Dimmu Borgir
Forward onward marchForgive, we shall not
Forget, we shall not
With trickery and treat
Enemies will face defeatNo place for dreamers
As our formation is lava
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns, so it burnsConstant retribution calling
From the shadows of three consecutive sixes
Merging with the cold dark vacuum
Talent is worthless unless exercised
When the world is turning
You'll find your true nature
When the first is last and the last is first
You'll be where you choose to be
You'll be where you choose to be
Forgive, we shall not
Forget, we shall not
Fire is with or against you
And so it burns
