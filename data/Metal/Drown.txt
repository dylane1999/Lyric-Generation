What doesn't kill you
Makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
One more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold upIt comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath
And let it bury me
I'm not ok
And it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
Who will make me fight?
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drownWhat doesn't destroy you
Leaves you broken instead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take one more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold upIt comes in waves
I close my eyes
Hold my breath
And let it bury me
I'm not ok
And it's not alright
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
Who will make me fight?
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown'Cuz you know that I can't do this on my own.
Who will fix me now?
Who will fix me now?Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself
don't let me drown
