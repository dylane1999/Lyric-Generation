We are wandering warriors on the waves
In the cold northern fjordlands
We are coming to your homelands on the sea
With his eye on our side
Odin, king of the Aesir, guides our hearts
On the path to Valhalla
With shimmering swords and brightly shining spears
We will conquer your kind

So we ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail to take what we need.
We will ride on the endless horizon
We sail across the sea

Turn the sail hard to port!

So we ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail to take what we need.
We will ride on the endless horizon
We sail across the sea

We leave your town in ashes and in flames
Proud to have been your foes
We conquered all your kindred and your homes
And taken all that we need
We are sailing on to a new horizon
Endlessly we shall go
Ahti, guide our ship to safety and to our next victory

We will ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail on to victory!
We will ride on the endless horizon
Valhalla calls to me!

I the viking warrior!
I the motherless son!
I the slayer of families
Why? I have no one!
I the wandering warrior!
I the unstoppable foe!
I will burn and pillage
Why? I have no home!

Why?
