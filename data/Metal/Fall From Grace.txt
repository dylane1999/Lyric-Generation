At the end of your rope
Hanging by a thread
He'd give anything for this to just go away
This grip is only so strong

I try to hold on tightly
But it's all slipping through my fingers
In a fleeting moment
Aspirations bled dry
Eyes that once beamed with hope now only stare in remorse

Even through this pain
I will feel again
Even through these tears
I will love again
Even through this pain
I will feel again
Even through these tears
I will love again

There will be no pity
There will be no sorrow
For today these hands may tremble
But this heart will never give in

Even through this pain
I will feel again
Even through these tears
I will love again
Even through this pain
I will feel again
Even through these tears
I will love again

And I will not fall
Fall from grace
And I will not fall

I
I will not fall from grace
I will not fall from grace

You're at the end of your rope
You're at the end of your rope
You're at the end of your rope
I will feel again
You're at the end of your rope
I will love again
