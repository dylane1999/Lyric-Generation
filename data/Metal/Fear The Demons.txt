Creeping and Cracking
Baby don't look back, no one goes home tonight
The evil we see and the evil we do
Brings out the beast in me and you
Waking up from screaming
You think it's all in your head
My my, it's a bad day to be alive
It's crawling under your skin and feeds of your hate
Just close your eyes and wait till the sun goes down

You better stay awake
The dark comes knocking so you better start running
Fear the demon in me, Fear the demon in you

Hear the voices calling you
Shadow's tongue licking your flesh
Rips the clothes clean of your body
Strip you clean straight down to the bones

You can't stay awake, You can't fall asleep
He's coming for your life
Don't wanna wake up dead, you know you're over your head
There ain't no turning back

You better stay awake
The dark comes knocking so you better start running
Fear the demon in me, Fear the demon in you

Laying in sweet tears

Dreams are turning into a living hell
The nightmares you see and the terror you feel
Takes a turn for the worse and becomes real

You better stay awake
The dark comes knocking so you better start running
Fear the demon in me, Fear the demon in you
