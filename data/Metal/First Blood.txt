I've gone and got myself, In trouble full of Hate
Changing all my ways, Before it was to late

Shades of bood is all I see, I could not hold my tears
Fragments of what used to be, Another fate was sealed

Don't believe it wont come true
It'll happen soon to me and you
People say you can't deny
Your blood runs hot before you die.

First blood
I never will forget
This day that changed my life
First Blood
Is filling up my head
When I close my eyes
First Blood

A dying man lies in the dirt, A bullet in his face
He's twitching as he wets him self, In this godforsaken place

For those who kill their fellow man, Don't you cross my way
For you I am the law, On this, your dying day

Don't believe it won't come true
It'll happen soon to me and you
People say you can't deny
Your blood runs hot before you die.

First blood
I never will forget
This day that changed my life
First Blood
Is filling up my head
When I close my eyes
First Blood

And even though you try
You can run but you cannot hide
First Blood
Who's mama gonna cry
As time goes by
First Blood

And even though you try
You can run but you cannot hide
First Blood
Whose mama gonna cry
As time goes by
First Blood

I never will forget
This day that changed my life
First Blood
Is filing up my head
When I close my eyes
First Blood
