Too much coffee's gonna shatter my nerves,
too much whiskey's gonna stutter my words
A whole lot of speed gonna take me to fast,
how much longer can I last

Too many women gonna put me to waste,
too much money gonna spoil my taste
Doctor says to slow down if you wanna stay alive,
how am I gonna survive - I wanna know
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know, oh yea
Been working to hard don't got no time to rest,
don't look to well I ain't feeling my best
Can't push much harder before I fall on the ground,
I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown

I've gotta slow down,
get my feet on the ground, yeah
I better slow down fast,
today could be my last, all right
