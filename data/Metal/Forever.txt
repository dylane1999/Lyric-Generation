I stand alone in the darkness
The winter of my life came so fast
Memories go back to my childhood
To days I still recallOh how happy I was then
There was no sorrow, there was no pain
Walking through the green fields
Sunshine in my eyesI'm still there everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
I never stayed anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees
Would you wait for me forever?I'm still there everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
I never stayed anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees
Would you wait for me forever?
Would you wait for me forever?
Will you wait for me forever?
