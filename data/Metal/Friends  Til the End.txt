Doc's heard a man had come to town, as his dying bed he lies
he's here to take his brother down, Docs deed before he dies
he knows when they are gonna meet, he knows what he has to do
he's walking down the empty street, got one more thing to do

Friends till the end, it's more than a word an eternal hand
Friends till the end, much more you understand?
Friends till the .....

behold the man from far away, as he's reaching for his gun
he's lucky on his dying day, this quickdraw game just won
he leans the man there on the tree, pulls his hat down over his eyes
the only thing that he can see, his brothers longer alive

Friends till the end, it's more than a word an eternal hand
Friends till the end, much more you understand?
Friends till the end, an act of forgiveness to finalize
Friends till the end, straight between the eyes

He's going back into his room, the great challenge he has killed
he knows that death is coming soon, to save his brothers soul's fullfilled

Friends till the end, it's more than a word an eternal hand
Friends till the end, much more you understand?
Friends till the end, an act of forgiveness to finalize
Friends till the end, straight between the eyes
