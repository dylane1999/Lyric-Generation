Alone in sadness
You are pure and innocent
All suffering in your eyes
So love decides
It's time to lose it all
In your paradise we stayed
Lost and lonely you are

In memories
You're all we used to be
A frozen broken heart
Ready to lose it all
Love's running out too fast
It's all we have
This all reminds about how in love and lost we are

You stayed, alone in your sorrow
So far away
Where the sunbeams never reach
All alone and lost we are
Your loneliness
It could be here to stay
In your paradise you stay
So lost and lonely you are

In memories
You're all we used to be
A frozen broken heart
Ready to lose it all
Love's running out too fast
It's all we have
This all reminds about how in love and lost we are
