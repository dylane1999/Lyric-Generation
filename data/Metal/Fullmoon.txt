Sitting in a corner all alone,
staring from the bottom of his soul,
watching the night come in from the window windowIt'll all collapse tonight, fullmoon is here again
In sickness and in health, understanding so demanding
It has no name, there's one for every season
Makes him insane to know...Running away from it all
"I'll be safe in the cornfields", he thinks
Hunted by his own,
again he feels the moon rising on the skyFind a barn which to sleep in, but can he hide anymore
Someone's at the door, understanding too demanding
Can this be wrong, it's love that is not ending
Makes him insane to know...She should not lock the open door
(run away, run away, run away)
Fullmoon is on the sky and He's not a man anymore
She sees the change in him but can't
(run away, run away, run away)
See what became out of her man... Full moonSwimming across the bay,
the night is gray, so calm today
She doesn't wanna wait.
"We've gotta make the love complete tonight..."In the mist of the morning he cannot fight anymore
Hundred moons or more, he's been howling
Knock on the door, and scream that is soon ending
Mess on the floor again...She should not lock the open door
(run away, run away, run away)
Fullmoon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore
She see the change in him but can't
(run away, run away, run away)
See what became out of her manShe should not lock the open door
(run away, run away, run away)
Fullmoon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore
She sees the change in him but can't
(run away, run away, run away)
See what became out of her darling manShe should not lock the open door...
(run away, run away, run away)
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore
Whoa... Whoa!
See what became out of that man
