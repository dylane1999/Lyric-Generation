Lost in the darkness I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and Saviour
Help me make it through the night

Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom
I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil
Run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow
They kill steal and borrow there is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes you cannot exhume my soul

Who do you trust
When corruption and lust
Creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me when can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer
Is God really dead?

Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy until my dying breath
I transfer from reality into a living dead
I empathize with enemies until the time is right
With God and Satan at my side. From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine, I don't need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Solo]

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide.
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side

Do you believe a word
What the good book said?
Or is it just a holy fairy tale and God is dead?

God is dead [4x]
Right

[Solo]

But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don't believe that God is dead

God is dead [3x]
