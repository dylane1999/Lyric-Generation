It's breaking dawn
This insurgency is on
We are taking back what's ours tonight
It's ours tonight
We'll slit their throats and break their backs
Pile their bodies in tall stacks
Kill them all until the morning light

We are shadows in the dark
We can strike from anywhere
But for liberty we march
Stand against us don't you dare
Raise your fist and show you care

High high raise 'em high
Tonight we light the sky
High high raise 'em high
I am the revolution
High high raise 'em high
Rebellion you and I
High high raise 'em high
They burned our constitution

Annihilation of a democratic nation
An eagle bitten by a poison bite
This snake will die and lose its head
We'll show them why our flag has red
Eradicate these serpents from our sight

We are shadows in the dark
We can state from anywhere
But for liberty we march
Stand against us don't you dare
Raise your fist and show you care

High high raise 'em high
Tonight we light the sky
High high raise 'em high
I am the revolution
High high raise 'em high
Rebellion you and I
High high raise 'em high
They burned our Constitution

No more debating
No more talking
No more waiting
We made our choice
We know what's wrong and right
You're god damn right
We burned it down to build again
We cleansed this land of all your sin
You had no choice against our metal might
