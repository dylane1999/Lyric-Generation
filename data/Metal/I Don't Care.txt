I try to make it through my life
In my way there's you...
I try to make it through these lies
That's all I doJust don't deny it
Just don't deny it
And deal with it
Yeah, deal with it
You tried to break me
You wanna break me
Bit by bit
That's just part of itIf you were dead or still alive
I don't care
I don't care
And all the things you left behind
I don't care
I don't careI try to make you see my side
Always try to stay in line
But your eyes see right through
That's all they do
I'm getting tired of this shit
I've got no room when it's like this
What you want of me, just deal with itSo...If you were dead or still alive
I don't care
I don't care
And all the things you left behind
I don't care
I don't careNothing can care about
I'm taking care of it
You won't be there for me
You won't be there for meIf you were dead or still alive
I don't care
I don't care
And all the things you left behind
I don't care
I don't careIf you were dead or still alive
I don't care (nothing can care about)
I don't care... (I'm taking care of it)
And all the things you've left behind
I don't care (you won't be there for me.)
I don't care... at all
