Tightening it's grip on me
My moral compass spinning
Draining my live empty
Give me something to believe in

Wounded up, I'm way too tight
Fear tearing, wearing me thin
And knowing it ain't right
Give me something to believe in

Wanna move on, gotta face the music
There's only one way out
Tired of stumbling
Searching endlessly
And giving in to more than doubt

So let them take all that they can
Each one of them, I will not break
So let them take all that they can
Each one of them, I will not break

Headstrong your apathy
Neurotic and quite nervous
Obtuse propensity
Still convinced it serves your purpose

Lacking the sense to care
Degrading and pubescent
Discretion worse for wear
Is this something to believe in

Wanna move on, gotta face the music
There's only one way out
Tired of stumbling
Searching endlessly
And giving in to more than doubt

So let them take all that they can
Each one of them, I will not bend
So let them take all that they can
Each one of them I will not break

Know I have to walk
Have to walk away
Never seemed to fit most of the time
I'll be better off
Better off this way
And taking back what's mine

Wanna move on, gotta face the music
There's only one way out
Tired of stumbling
Searching endlessly
And giving in to more than doubt

So let them take all that they can
Each one of them, I will not bend
So let them take all that they can
Each one of them, I will not bend
