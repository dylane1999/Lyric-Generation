I owe you a love song
For everything I done wrong
Don't worry about the long haul
The first time is hard
I'll help you make the short jump
You won't be here long
You know that we'll find a way!

I owe you a love song
For everything I done wrong
Just out the gates, son,
All cons love their moms
When you hear the dog's howl
Suck a reed in the swamp
Lie in the weeds, away...

Run!

Hey, hey, hey
Hey oh, hey oh
You'll be long gone;
I'll be waiting, son!
