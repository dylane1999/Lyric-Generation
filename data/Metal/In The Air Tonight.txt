I smell a mutiny I feel it in the air
Still a million miles away and donât fit anywhere
Just a piece of destiny of futures to be told
We raise our arms in unity our fortunes to behold

Thereâs no sanctity no place for me no ordinary man
Itâs no mystery you know I can

Thereâs a chill in the air tonight
Nothing can ever be alright
Close my eyes I see the signs theyâve been there all my life
Thereâs a chill in the air tonight
Gone are those walls you hide behind
Say your prayers and make it right

I was caught between right and wrong with no where to belong
Locked up on the words I thought my mind keeps going strong
Raise you head among the living dead the endless mind control
Still trapped inside the universe no comfort for my soul

Thereâs no place for me no sanctuary no shelter from this storm
Lost our unity we see the world reborn

Thereâs a chill in the air tonight
Nothing can ever be alright
Close my eyes I see the signs theyâve been there all my life
Thereâs a chill in the air tonight
Gone are those walls you hide behind
Say your prayers and make it right
Thereâs a chill in the air

Thereâs a chill in the air tonight
Nothing can ever be alright
Close my eyes I see the signs theyâve been there all my life
Thereâs a chill in the air tonight
Gone are those walls you hide behind
Say your prayers and make it right
Thereâs a chill in the air
