You've fallen from grace.
The whore you are.
Is all that you will ever know.

Swallow these words, 
Open wide for the camera.

You built the bridge,
I burned it down.
The house you slept in,
I'll burn it down.
You are nothing short of worthless.
You'll swallow every word.
Prepare yourself for asphyxiation.

Just know that,
You'll never see it coming.
I'll be the last thing that you see.
Before you cut your fucking throat.

look into my eyes,
While you cut your throat.
Give me that much.

You will give up everything,
You spun this web.
You brought this on yourself.

The days are counting down.
The clock is running tired.
The end is near.

No forgiveness, no worth.
You are nothing, you always will be.

You have given everything.
You are nothing, you always will be.

You will give everything to me.
The life you save won't be your own.

You will give everything to me.
To keep yourself alive.
Was it really worth it now?
