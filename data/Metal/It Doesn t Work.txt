I took one pill
Just to fall asleep
And wish myself
Only stop to think
The ashtray's full
And walls stare at me
I took this drug
To drown in everything

Next restless night
The streetlight's green
My bleary eyes seeÂ 
What no one sees

Why it doesn't work
Why I'm now so torn
There is so much anxiety in me
Why it doesn't work

Paralysis
Numbing limbs
The urgency of a sleep
overshadows other needs
Desperation
Handful of pills
I hear voices in my room
I know, I won't sleep

My sweaty hands
And pulsing bugling veins
The sleeping pill
Caused me dreams ereased
Next sleepless night
The loss of time
My bleary eyes see
So strange things

Paralysis
Numbing limbs
The urgency of a sleep
overshadows other needs
Desperation
Handful of pills
I hear voices in my room
I know, I won't sleep

Why it doesn't work
Why I'm now so torn
There is so much anxiety in me
Why it doesn't work
