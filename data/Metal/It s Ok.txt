Hear me say it's ok there just is no other way
I believe and strongly feel some things just aren't meant to be

All the time in our lives something somewhere draws a line
I believe in time you'll see sometimes some thing are best let be

You may find between the lines lotsa things you missed first time
But that's ok now hear me say we all learn from our mistakes

Yes I'll be all right
Yes I think I'll be all right
I hope I'll be all right
Yes I wish I'll be all right
It's ok

Comed this far it's who we are and what and how that takes us far
So just proceed leave history behind but make sure your hands are clean

Halt for a while now would you try to change things given one more try
Sure I know the level is low but never fail and you'll never know

You may find between the lines...

Yes I'll be all right...

All the time in our lives...

You may find between the lines...

Yes I'll be all right...
