My dreams are always the same, I see you
Fear is my best friend it keeps me alive
What is it I got that triggers you to follow me day and night?
I can smell your stench all around

I don't know what your demons are telling you
But it ain't me you're looking for
Why? Why won't you leave me alone
It drives me insane
Why? Why won't you just let me go
Stay out of my way

Never sleep with your enemies,
They'll steal all that you got
Framed by the lust
You spin out of controll

I don't know what your demons are telling you
But it ain't me you're looking for
Why? Why won't you leave me alone
It drives me insane
Why? Why won't you just let me go
Stay out of my way

Don't mess with my head
What triggers you I don't understand

Why? why won't you leave me alone
It drives me insane
Why? Why won't you just let me go
Stay out of my way
