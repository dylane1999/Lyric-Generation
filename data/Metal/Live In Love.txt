Just live in love.
Believe in love.

In my life I have seen all the ways hatred destroys mankind.
Break societyâs system, change the mercy, thereâs no compromise.

Don't mistake kindness and compassion for weakness,
It takes so much more strength to be selfless and live in love.

[Chorus:]
Strive to live in selflessness, and live in love.
Through all our days, just live in love.
Through all your pain, believe in love.

Love.

All that you think you know; itâs just a fraction of this world,
Take the time to think about your life.
Live righteous.

[Chorus II:]
Strive to live in selflessness, and live in love.
Through all our days, just live in love.
Through all your pain, believe in love.

The words we speak, the ones we donât say.
Power you donât know you could sing.
Through all our days, believe in love.

Donât you see we are all.
Donât you see we are all the blood brothers and sisters.
We are blood brothers and sisters.
We are one.
We are one.

And I pray this is not in vain!

[Final Chorus:]
All that you know about, all you can hide,
All that you feel inside (Live in love).
All that you know about, all you can hide,
All that you feel inside (Live in love).
Through all our days, Live in love.
Through all our pain, Believe in love.
