Here we go again
A night filled with everything but sleep
Trying to catch up to you
Inside of this maze of one-way streets

Every single turn, seems our story burns
But I won't accept defeat

The flames might be growing high
But I'm gonna stay and fight
I'm not gonna run
Bring on and let's see the smoke rise
We're not getting lost in the fire

Guilt will fuel the pain
And I won't get caught up in regrets
Burn, just let it all burn
We'll get out alive with one last breath

Let the battle rage, I am not afraid
And I won't accept defeat

The flames might be growing high
But I'm gonna stay and fight
I'm not gonna run
Bring on and let's see the smoke rise
We're not getting lost in the fire

By the skin of our teeth
We'll survive in one piece
If you hold on tight
We can get through this
If you'll believe

The flames might be growing high
But I'm gonna stay and fight
I'm not gonna run
Bring on and let's see the smoke rise
We're not getting lost in the fire

But I'm gonna stay and fight
I'm not gonna run
Bring on and let's see the smoke rise
We're not getting lost in the fire
