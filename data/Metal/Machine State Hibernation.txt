Burning down, thoughts in mind decay.
Hibernate an evolving phase.

Dread, life, drug, freedom, patience, exhale, burden, survive

Stabilize the weakness
Exterminate what breeds a lie and grow.

Violate, broken laws imposed.
To worship, my choice your belief.

Dread, life, drug, freedom, patience, exhale, burden, survive

Sacrifice for future survival to realize.
Suffering to multiply, a stringent growth empowered on you.

All of my memories, looking back at my
Future revival cry.

Denying the welcoming.
Hyper psychotic emptiness inside.

Hate life, with the time moving backwards.
Flickers, lies unstable.
Believe thy fucking brains fear induced.
Liar, Iâm not afraid of you.

Burning down, thoughts in mind decay.
Hibernate an evolving phase.

Dread, life, drug, freedom, patience, exhale, burden, survive

Sacrifice for future survival to realize.
Suffering to multiply, a stringent growth empowered on you.

Take the rise, as a life, served the year, been deprived.
Machine State Hibernation.

All rage withheld one day will dominate.
Power-rise, Iâm not afraid of you.
