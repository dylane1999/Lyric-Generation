In the heat of the night, when the tension is right
Letâs get out and have a mighty adventure
You are born to be free, donât you raise any plea
Join the battle, be a sacred avenger

Revolution is calling, forever theyâll hear your scream
From the dust, till the morning, the fire is burning free

Make some noise
When you got the choice to do so
Noise
The world that you are a hero
Noise
Let the sound of the wild talk to you
Forever you raise your voice
To make some noise

Plug your axe in the amp, turn the volume to ten
Shake the ground and play the songs of the devil
Put your fist in the air, show the world you are there
Shout it out so they all know that youâre special

Revolution is calling, forever theyâll hear your scream
From the dust, till the morning, the fire is burning free

Make some noise
When you got the choice to do so
Noise
The world that you are a hero
Noise
Let the sound of the wild talk to you
Forever you raise your voice
To make some noise

For truth weâre fighting, weâre strong as steel
Stand up and shout out your appeal

Make some noise
When you got the choice to do so
Noise
The world that you are a hero
Noise
Let the sound of the wild talk to you
Forever you raise your voice
To make some noise
