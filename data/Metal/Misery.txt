These are those days
when I am yours
pathetic little naked doll
I'd like to give
my life inte your hands
Forget that I asked
forgive me for what I am

I close my eyes
I still can see
You are right here
where I want you to be
Forget that asked
forgive me for what I say

My baby cheated on me
The whole world
turned its back on me
She left me here
in this Misery
The whole world
turned its back on me

My speeding heart
is overloaded
I got to know
what's going on
I'd like to help you
only today
Forget that asked
forgive me for what I say
