no one around to
hear your scream
no matter what you say
you're too far away...
you and i alone
alone in the dark
twisted thoughts throughout my head
i didn't even get started yet!
ask yourself the question
is this all really the end?
answers' yes
you can't prepare yourself
for what's about to come
better to do it here
than at the little park
the struggle you put up
no match for my technique
your body tenses as your garments are torn to shreds
forced entry
with cruel intent
bend over
time for me to torment
ask yourself the question
is this all really the end?
answers' yes
you can't prepare yourself
for what's about to come
i'm cutting down to the bone
now i'm in the zone
watching you beg gets me off
limbs... tied... behind... your back
one move and you're done...
one word and you're fucked
not one sound you cunt...
one word and you're fucked
your lifetime is running low
scream all you want
i've heard it all before
guess what
times up
suffer... suffer
