Loving arms around us
For you're the kind who needs refuge
Your loving eyes see right trough me
Cannot play saint,
Cannot pretend.

Neverending rain on your little parade
Nothing to do with a love affair
When heaven cries I will be near you
And walk with you trough all your pains.

Do not forget, what we are
Until the end, meant to be one.
When heaven cries and you are gone
You stole my soul,
It breaks my heart.

Do not forget what we are..

... and you are gone...
