Don't try to shape yourself, On something you're not, Don't try to break your point of view
There is a right spot
Don't try to chain your attitude, A reason why, You have to fail and fall
Before you can Fly
Feel your bones crushing in, Feel your heart beating skin, In thee, you feel the blame
The thorn of mistake
(But then you'll heal)

Feel like a Newborn, Feel like a Newborn
Everytime you fall

Take your steps embrace this life, Throughout your touch, you can't predict it all
That's overmuch!!!
So realize what's high above, Our dignity, A starting point of change, A new degree

Feel your bones crushing in, Feel your heart beating skin, In thee, you feel the blame
The thorn of mistake
(But then you'll heal)

Feel like a Newborn, Feel like a Newborn
Everytime you fall
