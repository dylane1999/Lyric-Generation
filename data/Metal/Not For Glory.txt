What are you searching for?

Search for a savior
All you find is me
Wonât be no miracles
Just a plague on humanity

When will you see
That with every breathe that you breathe
Youâre one step loser to the end?

The march begins
Moving slowly towards the edge
Fueled by your screams
And dreams of destiny

Try to fight it
But thereâs a better way
Canât ever hide it
All you reach for
Will be pulled away

Prepare to receive
Murder, death and disease
From dust we all rise
And soon dust we shall be

Try to fight it
But thereâs a better way
Canât ever hide it
All you reach for
Will be pulled away

Killers born and bred
To never yield till he lay dead
One who fights for blood
Not for glory
