I tried to pretend that you were fine
And all was okay now
But I couldn't ignore the rapid decline
That's taken you somehow
I watched it slowly take over you
It left you so helpless
There was really nothing that I could do
But sit there and witness

I saw your face in all my dreams
The greatest thing I've ever seen
Sent crazy shivers up and down my spine
It was like yesterday
If only I could make you stay
I wish that I could see you one more time

I wasn't ready to say goodbye
Because it's so hard to
It felt like I was going to die
The moment I lost you
My life's so crazy now that you're gone
Don't want to believe it
And all the emptiness is so strong
I really can't take it

I saw your face in all my dreams
The greatest thing I've ever seen
Sent crazy shivers up and down my spine
It was like yesterday
If only I could make you stay
I wish that I could see you one more time
