I open my eyes another day is here
The sun's already high
Can not recall just what I was dreamin'
But I'm sure I can catch the reprise somehow

Piles of dirty socks just everywhere
I don't feel like washing up today
Somehow I really just don't care
I think I'll stay in bed all day

This is one of those days when I'll do just not a thing
Lazing 'til the hour's late then maybe I'll sleep just a little wink

I know that breakfast can wait until later
I don't have anything but the dish in the kitchen
Nothing to read nothing's on the TV
Everyone's on vacation can't say that I miss 'em

This is one of...
