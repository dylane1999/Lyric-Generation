i won't allow it.
i won't let it happen.
this weakness will be strengthened.
take away this battle.
let our fire burn within.
purify.
purify.
don't release Your hand from me.
i must surrender, must lay it down.
what's to gain in my selfishness?
what will i promote,
and what will be pushed back?
my hope must rise, strength come forward.
linking my hand in.
i won't let it happen.
this weakness will be strengthened.
take away this battle.
let our fire burn within.
purify.
purify.
don't release Your hand from me.
i must surrender, must lay it down.
what's to gain in my selfishness?
what will i promote,
and what will be pushed back?
my hope must rise, strength come forward.
linking my hand in Yours,
let Your chains uphold me.
i won't break the bond.
no more will i remain the same.
my God has ever loved Himself in me.
i am convinced.
i must stay.
