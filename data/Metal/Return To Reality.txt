Brothers and sisters take a look around at this polluted perverse world we live in
What is the latest fashion? What's the latest trend?
On your list of priorities these shouldn't even make the top ten
So what's going to be next? I think we all just need to take a step back
Take a step back take a look to see what's really going on
What we can do to get the fallen on their feet
This is the death of the flesh
Lets end the separation
With all the love in our hearts
Today we stand united
Just when you thought you had it all together
Someone came behind you and pulled the rug from under your feet
How does that make you feel?
How could their impudence make you want to turn the other cheek
What's done is done just set it aside turn from their ways take back your life
Animosity has crowded the streets we walk
Deception has poisoned the air we breathe
Return to reality this is no longer your carefree fantasy
Lift up your heads O ye gates so we can see
