We crossed the withered Valley on our Search for Destiny
From Heaven down to Hades, on the Ground and on the Sea
We are running for Salvation, we are bound by holy Steel
To an unknown Destination, our Blood is pure and clean

Smash like a Tornado, we're the Storm
Like a fast Torpedo near the Shore

Raise your Voices, show the World we're fre
Yeah yeah
Running for Salvation
Cross the Borders wild and fast we'll be
Yeah yeah
Running for Salvation

It is more than a Religion, it's the Iron Truth we feel
And the only Gods we pray to are the Gods of War and Steel
We are born to be the Heroes of the coming Age of Faith
We are shooting high the Arrows to create a foreseen Reign

Smash like a Tornado, we're the Storm
Like a fast Torpedo near the Shore

Raise your Voices, show the World we're fre
Yeah yeah
Running for Salvation
Cross the Borders wild and fast we'll be
Yeah yeah
Running for Salvation
