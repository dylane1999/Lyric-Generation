Face down in the john
Is where you belong
Gasping for air i watch you
Struggle and squirm
Sadistic tortures is how
I get myself off

Make sure you dont scream i tape your mouth shut
Sharpening my blade, watching you quiver in fear
Tied to the chair
You know that torture is coming

Feeling the knife creeping under your virgin skin
My ears are deaf to all you appaling screams
Sadistic torture is how
I get myself off

Tormenting you , such a pleasure
Life's ending soon
I'll find another

Tormenting you , such a pleasure
Life's ending soon
I'll find another
Victim for my amusement

Strike of my fist , twist of my knife
Eager just to take your life [x5]

BLAST!!!

I dont car for what you have to say
Your going to die a slow death
Nothing that you can do
To save your life suffering in agony
Im going to bleed you dry
As i bring the carnage on you

Strike of my fist , twist of my knife
Eager just to take your life [x2]

All the dismemberment all the pain
Gets me off making me go insane [x3]
