Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence
And leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage
For what resembles rage againSo if you love me let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Oooohh
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never knowI still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me
that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your lights
(Without your lights)
But all of that was ripped apart
When you refused to fightSo save your breath I will not care
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Oooh
My love was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you goOooohSo break Yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Oooh
My love was punished long ago
If you still care don't ever let me know
If you still care don't ever let me know
