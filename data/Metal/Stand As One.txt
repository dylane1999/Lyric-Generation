When the winter is hailing
All the wrecks on the road now fall apart
When all motors are failing
We are burning some gas in a metal cask

Took a glance in the dark
But we feel in our heart
That together we forge our fate
We are legends tonight
As we fight for our right
To survive in a world of hate

We face the mayhem with strong cohesion
We know that our time has come
So if you're seeking, we're calling
Together we will stand as one
Yeah, one!
Stand as one
Yeah, one!
Stand as one

Our hope is immortal
We are rebels, yeah rebels of our time
In our hearts is a portal
And it leads to a place where the stars still shine
