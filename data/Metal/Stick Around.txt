How many times do I daydream
About making love to you
And take you to a special place
Where it's only me and you
I'll put away all your troubles
On the other side of the world
And run my arms around your heart
And tell u you're my girl
So let's go steal away in the night
And we'll go far away from here
To the place where our love is right
Can I take you to my worldWhenever you're sad
Whenever you're crying
I'll be the one who wipes away your tears
Whenever you call
Whenever you need me
I'll be the one who runs to you
Giving my love
Well you know how much I love you
So you better not let me down
I'm not asking for too much babyJust stick aroundA quiet day in the country
Or a rainy night in my room
We'll hide away under my sheets
After the morning comes too soon
An afternoon in your eyes
Or a lifetime in your heart
Forever just ain't long enough
But at least it's a good start
Falling deeper in love with you
Will you be there to catch me girlAre you falling deep with me too
Can I keep you in my worldWhenever you're sad
Whenever you're crying
I'll be the one who wipes away your tears
Whenever you call
Whenever you need me
I'll be the one who runs to you
Giving my love
Well you know how much I love youSo you better not let me down
I'm not asking for too much baby
Just stick aroundForever... forever
Oh would you come on babyLet's go steal away in the night
And we'll go far away from here
To the place where our love is right
Oooh cozWhenever you're sad
Whenever you're crying
I'll be the one who wipes away your tears
Whenever you call
Whenever you need me
I'll be the one who runs to you
Giving my love
Well you know how much I love you
So you better not let me down
I'm not asking for too much baby
Just stick around
Forever... forever
