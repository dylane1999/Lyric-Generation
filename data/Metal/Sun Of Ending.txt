Beneath the sanguine glare of a sky on fire
The sun sets on this land for one final time
One last dawn, one last sunset, one last twilit halo
As we stand to embrace the everlasting night

Wolves howl, first one and then another
A pack gathering in the descending shroud of twilight
We open our eyes and look to the stars
And the silvery shard of the moon

The last flames of sol drench a blackening horizon
The shadows stretch, reaching and distended
Clawing a landscape that begins to shiver
Within the enfolding embrace of eternal dusk

The final flare of the death of day
Burns a soul already scoured with sorrow
Beaten and broken, I sink to weary knees
As the dwellers in shadow circle

And so huddled in torchlight, we steel our resolve
A union born of fear that gathers strength
With the passing of each moon and the forging of will
We sing our songs of defiance

Our voices ring as one
Against the onyx shield of the sky
Our torches burn as sol reborn
Burning as spirits that remain forever undimmed
