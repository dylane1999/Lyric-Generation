In the shallowed water
Where darkness lies within
A creature, feeding on lies and deceive

His thirst for flesh reigns
Dragging his victims down
Where darkness lies within

Close to the darkness of the deep forest
The unending cries, echoes through

Red painted water
Skies turning black
Another lost child
Thy mother, cries

Another empty grave

A story, foretold by fathers from memories past.
"Don't trust the man by the water.
Run as you see him, don't look back, close your eyes".
Yet denial runs deep and as the strife of mankind fades.
The man by the water, takes another life.
