Decades in the making
Lives left for the taking
Protecting those dismissing the will of all

Supremacy imposed through threats and fear
Chained to lies and false ideas

Can we rise above all wrong?
Sheltering all not just one
Leaving the plan that holds us as slaves to the madness

With the people not contained
True survival could be attained
Canât we find a way around?
A liberation forged on common ground!

History in the making
Lives left for the taking
Amnesty for those who accept the aggressors

It all comes down to a quest for wealth
Schemes and deceit suit them well
Empty shells

Can we rise above all wrongs?
Sheltering all not just one
Leaving the plan that holds us as slaves to this madness

With the people not contained
True survival could be attained
Can we find a way around?
A liberation forged on common ground!

Assaulting their minds
Through a world in decline
The final solution
Which poisoned their lives
Unheard are their cries!

Will we rise above the beast
Protecting all, never cease
And leave the plan that holds us
Breaking the chains that blind us

With the people not contained
True survival could be attained
Can we find a way around?
A liberation forged on common ground!
