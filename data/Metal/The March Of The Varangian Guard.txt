The sun rose ove the wasteland
As far as the eye can see
Sand fills the vast plains of Serkland

To end, but to pursure my own thread
To join the Varangian Guard!Guards of glory and of might

We are the Varangian Guard!Guards of glory and of might
Red as blood and black as night
Flies our banner as we march

Red as blood and black as night
Flies our banner as we march
In the East, for the king of the Greek
