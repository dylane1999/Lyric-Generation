We could be better on the other side
It could be better if we say goodbye
It could be better on the other side
So why donât we leave right now
Hand in hand into the darkest place
Where all the light is born

It could be better if we leave the world
Make a journey into the dark
Where dreams die and are reborn
Maybe this is our night

Suddenly I think this is the night
Suddenly I think this is our night
Trust in me, this is the night
Trust in me, this is our night
