The day is dark but you feel strong and brave inside
The war is on but you don't fear you'll not survive
Others fall in glory's name
With no doubt heart you run onward
Defying death and pain

Blood of warriors soaks the broken wasted land
To the last man fight - You must stand strong - Defend
For the crown and for the king
Spill more blood
While brothers dying - brothers fighting sing

Rise - legions - fight - legions
The swords are drawn - And then you die

You think that you're a hero - Not a brainwashed fool
You think you're something special - I got news for you
Those who died they thought the same
Just another victim on the road to hell
Pawn in the game

Blood of warriors soaks the broken wasted land
To the last man fight - You must stand strong - Defend
For the crown and for the king
Choke on blood
While brothers dying - Brothers fighting sing

Another tear shed - Another soul dead
