Staring in the eyes of death
You have reason to abandon hope
I am the reason you pray at night
I'll hollow you out
Rest in pieces
You won't be found

This is a storm of hatred
Running through your virgin mind
You'll beg &amp; plead for everything you love
It's a crushing malevolence
For you of apocalyptic volumes

No chance of escape
You will see this to the end

Till your veins run dry of blood
I will be there standing over you
It's hopeless

A crushing malevolence plays its part
Stuck in the back of your head

Everything leading up to this point
Was a constant reminder
Of happiness you'll never feel

Crushing your livelihood
With the weight of the world
Never relieving the pressure
Pressure [2x]
Just bleed

You will never feel again

To see all of your family surrendering
Mourning over your body
Is all I need to sleep at night
I'll sleep tonight

This is where it stops
Just lay there &amp; bleed

I'll hollow you out
Rest in pieces
You won't be found
This is a storm of hatred
Running through your virgin mind
