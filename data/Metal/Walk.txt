Can't you see? I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of timeRespect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Rock your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathizeCan you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belongYou can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself, stay away from me
A lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of time
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me? No way punk
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me? Walk on home boy
