Filled with hate since I came out of the nutsack
I'm the hog at the end of your rope
Drained of regrets, I can't look back
I am the slayer of hope

Face it
I'm what you wanna see
Even more
What you wanna be

Saturate the spirit of a peaceful man
Kill the one who never took a stand
The stage is set, come join the fun
I bet it sucks at that end of the gun

I.. won't... back... off
Just deal with the fact
Your time has come
Ain't that a bitch, you thought you knew me
My fist in your gut, I bet you feel me
Stare into my eyes, can you see the answer
I'm your death, your hell, your cancer
I'm your death, your hell, your cancer
I'm bringing war
Right to your door
Taste defeat as it sprays your face
The hog now reveling in your disgrace
War would end if the dead could return
And hell is a place where you won't get burned?

Who.. will... save.. you.. now?
War makes thieves
And peace will hang them
Ain't that a bitch, you thought you knew me
My fist in your gut, I bet you feel me
Stare into my eyes, can you see the answer
I'm your death, your hell, your cancer
I'm your death, your hell, your cancer
I'm bringing war
Right to your door
It's not the size of the dog in the fight
It's the size of the fight in the dog
War hog
Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity

It's not the size of the dog in the fight
It's the size of the fight in the dog
War hog
Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity
I.. won't... back... off

I'm your death, your hell, your cancer

This... will.. .kill... you
