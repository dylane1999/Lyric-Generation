Endless hours
I spent kneeling down
To my own creation

Looking up to your sky
Embracing my
own imagination...

When gods fall - charmed by a human
Calling a name that never should be told
Trapped in a true heart - opened by love
Caught by the spirit the self did not unfold

Heaven's doors
Suddenly opened up
And set you free

Your divine step
Touched mortal ground
Inspiring eternal dreams...
