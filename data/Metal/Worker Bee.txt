You're a worker bee
Can't you see?
A cog in the wheel
Of their factory
You'll do what you're told
Until you grow old
Or you get laid off
Because the company's sold

Change your mind
To change the way
You've lived up tilll now
Go somewhere
And have some fun
While you remember how

They'll buy a machine
Know what I mean?
It punches your holes
At twice the speed
And half the cost
Look at the boss
A smile on his face
He's laughing his ass off

Change your mind
To change the way
You've lived up tilll now
Go somewhere
And have some fun
If you remember how
