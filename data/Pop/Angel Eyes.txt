Ah-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha
Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, a-aahLast night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her
And say, "Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the priceLook into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh, no, no, no, noAh-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha
Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, a-aahSometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the priceLook into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyesCrazy 'bout his angel eyes, angel eyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh, no no, no, noAh-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aah
Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aah
Keep thinking, I had to pay the priceKeep thinking, ah-aah
Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aah
Keep thinking, I had to pay the price
