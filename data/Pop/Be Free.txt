Jump in the deep end,
Tryna swim but you're sinking,
I don't know the reason,
Just needed something different.
Don't gotta hear what they're speaking,
No no
Don't gotta take what they're giving,
Remember the meaning.
This old folk song we'll be singing.
Oh hoo
(Imma raise my arms high)
Oh hoo
(Imma touch the skyline)
Oh hooo
Imma sing it aloud like
Oh hooo
Let me, be freePallivaalu bhadravattakam
Kayyilentum thampuratti
Nallacchante thirumumpi chennu kali
kali thudangi anganangane
Pallivaalu bhadravattakam
Kayyilentum thampuratti
Nallacchante thirumumpi chennu kali
kali thudangi anganangane

Let me, be freeHeartbeat raising,
What you feel when your feet hit the pavement.
Keep on reaching,
Hold on to what you believe in.
Don't gotta learn what they're teaching,
No no
Don't believe what they're preaching.
Remember the meaning.
This old folk song we'll be singing.
