I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you throwing smiles in my face
Romantic talking? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right
Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buying
I wanna feel on yo' ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fucking and flying
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm riding
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm acting hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy
Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like
Oh, call me by your name (mmm, mmm, mmm)
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name (mmm, mmm, mmm)
I do not care if you lying
Well, I'm just feeling, mm-uh
I wanna get, mm-uh
I'm in my, into my, uh
I'm mm, mm
I'm still, mm, mm-mm, ooh
