You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, oh
See that girl, watch that scene
Diging the Dancing QueenFriday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a kingAnybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a danceAnd when you get the chanceYou are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeahYou can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, oh
See that girl, watch that scene
Diging the dancing queenYou're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a danceAnd when you get the chanceYou are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeahYou can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, oh
See that girl, watch that scene
