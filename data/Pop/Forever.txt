To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music around you, around you

So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me
It's like I waited my whole life
For this one night

'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun
And dance forever ever ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever

Forever on the dance floor
