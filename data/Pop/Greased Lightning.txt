It's systematic
It's hydromatic
Why it's grease lightning (Grease lightning)We'll get some overhead lifters and some four barrel quads
oh yeah
(Keep talking whoa keep talking)
A fuel injection cutoff and chrome plated rods oh yeah
(I'll get the money I'll get the money)
With a four speed on the floor they'll be waiting at the door
You know without a doubt we'll be running in and out
In Grease Lightning
