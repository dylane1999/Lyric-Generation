I remember so well
the day that you cameinto my life
you asked for my name
you have the most beautiful smile
My life started to change
i wake up each day feeling all right
with you right by my side
makes me feel things
will work out just fine
How did you know
i needed someone like you in my life
that there was an empty space in my heart
you came at the right time in my life
i never forget how you brought the sun to shine in my life
and took all the worries and fears that i had
i guess what i'm really trying to say
it's not everyday that someone like you comes my way
no words can express how much i love you
