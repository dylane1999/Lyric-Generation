Maybe far away
Or maybe real nearby
He may be pouring her coffee
She may be straightning his tie.
Maybe in a house
All hidden by a hill(Molly)
She's sitting playing piano(Tessie)
He's sitting paying a bill!(Annie)
Betcha they're young
Betcha they're smart(July)
Bet they collect things(Duffy)
Like ashtrays, and art.(Kate)
Betcha they're good(Pepper)
Why shouldn't they be?(Annie+Orphans)
Their one mistake
Was giving up me.(Annie)
So maybe now it's time,
And maybe when I wake(Annie+Orphans)
They'll be there calling me baby
Maybe.Betcha he reads
Betcha she sews
Maybe she's made me
A closet of clothes!
Maybe they're strict
As straight as a line...
don't really care
As long as they're mine!
So maybe now this prayer's
The last one of it's kind...
Won't you please come get your baby.(Annie+Orphans)
(rest, rest)
Maybe.
