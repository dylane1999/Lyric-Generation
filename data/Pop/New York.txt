Oooooooh, New York!
Oooooooh, New York!Grew up in a town that was famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on BroadwayEven if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams aby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do, now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!
On the avenue there ain't never a curfew ladies work so hardSuch a melting pot on the corner selling rock preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams baby I'm from New York!Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can comparePut your lighters in the air everybody say
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
In New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do now you're in New York!These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Now you're in New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New Yooork
