Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing
That I know.And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still.So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
Till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home.Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And is the only thing
That I know (know)
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still.So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
Till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone.And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go.Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home.Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul.And if you hurt me
Well that's okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go.When I'm away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home.
