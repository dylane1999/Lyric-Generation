Ooh... yeah... Ooh yeah... yeah ooh
When a day is said and done
In the middle of the night and your fast asleep, my love.
Stay awake looking at your beauty
telling myself Im the luckiest man alive
Cause so many times I was certain you was gonna walk out of my life (life)
Why you take such a hold of me girl
when Im still trying to get my act right.
What is the reason, when you really could have any man you want
I don't see, what I have to offer.
I shouldn't be in season, guess you could see I had potential.Do you know your my miracle?
Im like a statue, stuck staring right at you
Got me frozen in my tracks.
So amazed how you take me back
Each and everytime our love collapsed
Statue, stuck staring right at you
So when Im lost for words
Everytime i disappoint you
Its just cause I cant believeThat you're so beautiful. (Stuck like a statue)' wanna lose you, no. (Stuck like a statue)
Ask myself why are you even with me
After all the shit I put you through
Why did you make your heart song wit me
Its like you're living in an igloo
But baby your love is so warm it makes my shield melt down (down)
And everytime were both at war
You make me come around.
What is the reason, when you really could have any man you wantI don't see, what I have to offer for.
I shouldn't be in season, guess you could see I had potential.Do you know your my miracle?
Im like a statue, stuck staring right at you
Got me frozen in my tracks.
So amazed how you take me back
Each and everytime our love collapsed.
Statue, stuck staring right at you
So when Im lost for words
Everytime i disappoint you
Its just cause I cant believeThat you're so beautiful. (Stuck like a statue)
Don't wanna lose you, no. (Stuck like a statue)
And you're so beautiful. (Stuck like a statue)Don't wanna lose you, never. (Stuck like a statue)
Every single day of my life I thank my lucky stars
God really had to spend extra time, when he sculptured your heart.
Cause theres no explanation, cant solve the equation
Its like you love me more than I love myself.
Im like a statue, stuck staring right at you
Got me frozen in my tracks.
So amazed how you take me back
Each and everytime our love collapsed.
Statue, stuck staring right at you
So when Im lost for words
everytime i disappoint you
Its just cause I cant believe
That you're so beautiful. (You are the reason,)
Stuck like a statue. (The reason for living,)
Don't wanna lose you, no. (The reason for breathing)
Stuck like a statue. (You're so beautiful)
And you're so beautiful. (And I want you to feel it)
Stuck like a statue. (Cause so bad Im needing)
Don't wanna lose you, no. (You're the reason for breathing)
Stuck like a statue. (You're so beautiful)
When a day is said and done
And in the middle of the night you're fast asleep, my love...
Im the luckiest man alive
