All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot headed believer
I threw my hands in the air I said show me something
He said, "If you dare come a little closer"Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you knowNot really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the wayI want you to stayIt's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's givenRound and around, and around, and around we go
Oh, now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you knowNot really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stayOh, the reason I hold on
Oh, 'cause I need this hole goneFunny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is cavingNot really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, oh
