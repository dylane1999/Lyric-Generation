We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me

I've been dancing on top of cars
And stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark
Can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain
The tattoo inside my brain
And baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take you know that you'll find me

I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you)
About you (About you)
And you're making the typical me
Break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you

Yeah
Don't complicate it, yeah
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember
All of the nights I don't remember when you're 'round me

I've been dancing on top of cars
And stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark
Can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain
The tattoo inside my brain
And baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, ooh yeah
Any road you take you know that you'll find me

I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you)
About you (About you)
And you're making the typical me
Break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you

Yeah
(I'm a sucker for you)

I've been dancing on top of cars
And stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark
Can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain
The tattoo inside my brain
And baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, ooh yeah
Any road you take you know that you'll find me

I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you)
About you (About you)
And you're making the typical me
Break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you
I'm a sucker for you
