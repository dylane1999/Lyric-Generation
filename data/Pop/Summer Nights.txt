Summer lovin' had me a blast
Summer lovin' happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days driftin' away
To ah, oh, those summer nightsUh well-a well-a well-a huh!Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car?
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huhShe swam by me, she got a cramp
He ran by me, got my suit damp
I saved her life, she nearly drowned
He showed off, splashing around
Summer sun, something's begun
But ah, oh, those summer nightsUh well-a well-a well-a huh!Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huhTook her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling, drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed out 'til ten o'clock
Summer fling, don't mean a thing
But ah, oh, those summer nightsWhoa, whoa, whoa!Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a dragShoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop
Shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, shoo-bop bop, yeah!He got friendly, holding my hand
Well, she got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet, just turned eighteen
Well, she was good, you know what I mean
Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But ah, oh, those summer nightsWhoa, whoa, whoa!
Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?
It turned colder, that's where it ends
So I told her we'd still be friends
Then we made our true love vow
Wonder what she's doing now
Summer dreams ripped at the seams
But oh, those summer nights...
Tell me more, tell me more...
