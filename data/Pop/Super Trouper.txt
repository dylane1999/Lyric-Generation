Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's youI was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show (Wishing every show was the last show)So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different when I'm on the stage tonightTonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number oneTonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's youFacing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only (Still I'm thinking about you only)There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different when I'm on the stage tonightTonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number oneTonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's youSo I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive, and when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonightTonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number oneTonight the Super Trouper (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) beams are gonna blind me
