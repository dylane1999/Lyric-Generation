Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're going?
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'

I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin', yeah

Started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wanting more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're going?
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'

I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin', oh now

Penthouse view
Left some flowers in the room
I make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way
Swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can we just talk?
Can we just talk
Talk about where we're going?
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'

I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can we just talk?
Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

Figure out where we're goin'
