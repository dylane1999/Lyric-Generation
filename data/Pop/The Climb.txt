I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
You'll never reach itEvery step I'm taking
Every move I make feels
Lost with no direction
My faith is shakingBut I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held highThere's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to loseAin't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climbThe struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breakingI may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep goingAnd I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'causeThere's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to loseAin't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
YeahThere's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes you're gonna have to loseAin't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
Yeah, yeahKeep on moving, keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
