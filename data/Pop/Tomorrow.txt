The sun will come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow
There'll be sun!Just thinking about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs,
And the sorrow
'Til there's none!When I'm stuck in a day
That's gray,
And lonely,
I just stick out my chin
And Grin,
And Say,
OhThe sun will come out
Tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on
'Til tomorrow
Come what mayTomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love ya
Tomorrow!You're always a day awayWhen I'm stuck in a day
That's gray,
And lonely,
I just stick out my chin
And Grin,
And Say,
OhTomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love ya
Tomorrow!You're always
A day
A way!
