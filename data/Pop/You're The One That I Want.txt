I got chills, they're multiplying
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power, you're supplying
It's electrifyingYou better shape up, 'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand
To my heart I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to doYou're the one that I want
(You are the one I want)
Ho, ho, ho honeyYou're the one that I want
(You are the one I want)
Ho, ho, ho honeyYou're the one that I want
(You are the one I want)
Ho, ho, ho, the one that I need
Oh yes indeedIf you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate in my direction
Feel your wayI better shape up, 'cause you need a man
I need a man who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove
You better prove that my faith is justified
Are you sure? Yes I'm sure down deep insideYou're the one that I want
(You are the one I want)
Ho, ho, ho honeyYou're the one that I want
