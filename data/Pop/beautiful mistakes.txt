It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like, "One day, you'll come back to me"
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful, I can't believe how every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off to keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy-ayy)
Making beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doing something different, got me looking stupid (damn)
The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it, lucid (hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really, I was doing just fine without ya
Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You running outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (bed)
Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (yeah, yeah, oh-oh)
Making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah (in my head)
Nah-nah-nah (in my bed)
Nah-nah-nah (ayy, beautiful)
Making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah (ooh)
Nah-nah-nah
