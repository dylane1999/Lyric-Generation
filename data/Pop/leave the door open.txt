Said baby, said baby, said baby
What you doing? (What you doing?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?)
Don't say that (shut your trap)
I'm sipping wine (sip, sip) in a robe (drip, drip)
I look too good (look too good) to be alone (woo-woo)
My house clean (house clean), my pool warm (pool warm)
Just shaved (smooth like a newborn)
We should be dancing, romancing
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happening?
I ain't playing no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open hoping)
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're coming through)
Ooh, you're so sweet (so sweet), so tight (so tight)
I won't bite (ah-ah), unless you like (unless you like)
If you smoke (what you smoke?) I got the haze (Purple Haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (woo-woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me (waiting)
There's so much love we could be making (shamone)
I'm talking kissing, cuddling
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubbling
I ain't playing no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So (if you) if you (tryna) tryna lay in these arms
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open hoping)
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're coming through) Come on, girl
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (I need you, baby)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (I gotta see you, baby)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (girl, I'm tryna give you this)
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Hey-hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby (I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hoping) And I'm hoping, hoping
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're coming through) Woo!
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (tell me)
(Tell me that you're coming through)
Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (la-la-la, la-la)
(Tell me that you're coming through)
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you (oh!)
Come on over, I'll adore you (I gotta know!)
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (I'm waiting, waiting, waiting)
(Tell me that you're coming through) For you
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you
Come on over, I'll adore you
La-la-la, la-la-la-la (la-la, la-la)
