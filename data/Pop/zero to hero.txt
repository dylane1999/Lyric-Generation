Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro!
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O.He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he a hot shot
He's a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that!When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on ev'ry vase
(On every vahse)From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you what's a Grecian "earn"!Say "Amen"
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecsHercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains, and spunk
From zero to hero
A major hunk
Zero to hero
And who'd have thunk?Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver!
Is he sweet?
Our favorite flavor!Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, HerculesBless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceitedHe was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a hot-shot
He's our hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed!From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a heroYes indeed!
