Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Sally, take my hand
We'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older
Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
