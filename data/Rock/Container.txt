I was screaming into the canyon
At the moment of my death
The echo I created
Outlasted my last breathMy voice it made an avalanche
And buried a man I never knew
And when he died his widowed brideMet your daddy and they made youI have only one thing to do and that's
Be the wave that I am and then
Sink back into the ocean
I have only one thing to do and that's
To be the wave that I am and then
Sink back into the ocean
I have only one thing to do and that's
Be the wave that I am and then
Sink back into the ocean
(Sink back into the ocean)
Sink back into the o
Sink back into the ocean
Sink back into the o
Sink back into the ocean
Sink back into the ocean
