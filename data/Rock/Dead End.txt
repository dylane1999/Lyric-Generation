Desperate and a loser
A failure at his trade
Nothing more to live for
A decision that he made

He said that he's sorry
But that won't work this time

End of the line, end of the line

Bargained for his freedom
His last chance to run
Forced into a corner
And killed by his own gun

He said that he's sorry
But that won't work this time

End of the line, end of the line
End of the line, end of the line

Can't take it, can't take it, can't take it no more
Can't take it, can't take it, can't take it no more

He said that he's sorry
But that won't work this time

End of the line, end of the line, end of the line
End of the line, end of the line, end of the line
