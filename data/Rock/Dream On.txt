Every time when I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
And it went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books, written pages
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true, oh
All the things come back to you
Sing with me, sing for a year
Sing for the laughter, and sing the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream until the dream come true
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on, ah
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
