Hey girl, got no regrets. That might have been the best love yet.
Its a Goodbye world. Just passing through it.
And dont worry Ill be alright. Im out of the dark and into the light.
Its a Goodbye world. Just passing through it.
Dont cry, just because youre leaving, its alright.
Its a Goodbye World.Theres highways and exit signs, and three hour wait at the borderline
Goodbye World. Just passing through it.
I take a bus, hop a train, a rocketship, its all the same
Its a Goodbye world, just passing through it.
Dont cry, just because youre leaving, its alright.Its a Goodbye World
Its a Goodbye WorldHello, Goodbye, sea, sky falling
Hurray today is the day I comprehend
That all this stuff, this stuff is temporary.
Just here and gone in a Goodbye World.
Little slap, a baby cries, eighty years later somebody dies.Its a Goodbye World. Just passing through it.
Its a Goodbye World. I always knew it.
Its a Goodbye World. Just passing through it.
Dont cry just because youre leaving, its alright.
Its a Goodbye World.
