Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know!
It's been comin' for sometime
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain on a sunny dayI know!
Shining down like water
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hardI know!
Been that way for all my time
'Til forever on it goesThrough the circle fast and slow
I know!
It can't stop, I wonder
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?Yeah!
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
