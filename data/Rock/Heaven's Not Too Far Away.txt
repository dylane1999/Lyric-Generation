Honey I thought you should know that I'm in a hurry
I've got to move up north, but it's just temporary
I really tried not to lie, but this burdens getting heavy
No, you can't come with me this time, you got your own destiny
When I look at you I see your beauty
Now my baby boy he's gonna lose me
But heavens not too far away, I know someday you'll visit
And I didn't think I'd go this way, can I please have one more minute
No honey I don't want to go, please know that I have to
Look how the cancer has grown, I think it's time I go home
I can still hear your voice, sounds just like it did
And I can still feel your hand, when it touches my skin
But heavens not too far away, I know someday you'll visit
And I didn't think I'd go this way, can I please have one more minute
I gave you life now you gotta watch it leave my eyes
But heavens not too far away, I know someday you'll visit
As death rattles my cage, I can hear their voices fading
Each breath getting harder, I can hear the tears coming from my daughter
And to her older brother, he's thinking back when he was younger
When he had a healthy mother, who asked him to take care of his little brother
And he's not really sure about life, or that how could any of this be right
But I know my babies they will be fine, cause they can talk to me anytime
Cause, Heavens not too far away, I know someday you'll visit
I didn't think I'd go this way, can I please have one more minute
I gave you life now you gotta watch it leave my eyes
But heavens not too far away, I know someday you'll visit
Honey I thought you should know, that I'm in a hurry
I've got a move up north, but it's just temporary
