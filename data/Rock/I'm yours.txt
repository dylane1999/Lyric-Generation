Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get backBefore the cool-done run out, I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn someBut I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yoursWell, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, loveListen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, lovedSo I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yoursDoo ch doo doo doo joo
Ba doo ja doo ja doo doo ba
Do you want to come on a scooch on over closer, dear?
And I will nibble your earA soon da ba ba boom ba baum
Whoa, whoaI've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughedI guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtueBut I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yoursWell, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yoursSo please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This, oh, this, oh, this is our fate
I'm yours
