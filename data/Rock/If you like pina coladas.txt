I was tired of my lady
We've been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she laid there sleepin'
I red the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I red
If you like pi単a coladas
and getting cought in the rain
If you're not into yoga
if you haf half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
in the dunes of a cape
I'm the love that you looked for
write to me and escape
...
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kinda mean
but me and my old lady
have fallen into the same old routine
so I wrote to the paper
took out a personal add
and thoug I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad
Yes I like pi単a coladas
and getting cought in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champange
I've got to get you by tomorrow
and cut thru all this red tape
at a bar ...
where we plan our escape
...
So I waited with high hopes
and she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
it was my old lovely lady
and she said "oh it's you"
then we laughed for a moment
and I said I neve knew
that you like pi単a coladas
and getting cought in the rain
and the feel of the ocean
and the taste of champange
if you like making love at midnoghts
in the dunes of a cape
you're the lady I looked for
come with me and escape
If you like pi単a coladas
and getting cought in the rain
if you're not into yoga
if you have half a brain
if you like making love at midnights
in the dunes of a cape
I'm the love that you lookes for.
