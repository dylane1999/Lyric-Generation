It starts with
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due timeAll I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life awayIt's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you goI kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time whenI tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matterOne thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to remind myself how I tried so hardIn spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so farThings aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the endYou kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time whenI tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matterI've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should knowI've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should knowI tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
