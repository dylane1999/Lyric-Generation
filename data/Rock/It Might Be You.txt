Time...
I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching sea birds flyWishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life
Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my lifeWondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you
So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some timeMaybe all we need is time...
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my lifeI've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be youYeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life
It's you, It's you
I've been waiting for all of my life
Maybe it's you (It's you), maybe it's you (It's you)
I've been waiting for you all of my life
Maybe it's you, maybe it's you
I've been waiting for all of my life
