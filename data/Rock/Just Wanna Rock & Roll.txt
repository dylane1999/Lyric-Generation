Oh well, I think the time is comin' to
show you what we got.
You got to let your feelings move,
you know you got to feel it from your heart.
And if ya' think that you can do this,
I'm gonna show you how tonight.
How this good old rockin' music
will make you feel alive.

Oh 'cause I just wanna rock 'n' roll.
I'm just tryin' to ease your soul.
'Cause I know you want to rock 'n' roll.

Oh can't you see what music's givin'?
It will show you the way.
Now how to let your troubles leave you,
don't think about your troubles today.
And if ya' listen to the music
you will feel what I'm tryin' to say.
Oh how this good old rockin' music will
make you see the way.

Oh 'cause I just wanna rock 'n' roll.
I'm just tryin' to ease your soul.
'Cause I know you want to rock 'n' roll.

Well I just want to tell you people
what you need to do.
Blow away your troubled life,
this song's for you. Yeah, you!

Because I just wanna rock 'n' roll.
I'm just tryin' to ease your soul.
'Cause I know you want to rock 'n' roll.
You got to rock and roll.

'Cause I just wanna rock 'n' roll.
I'm just tryin' to ease your soul.
'Cause I know you want to rock 'n' roll.
Just wanna rock and roll!
