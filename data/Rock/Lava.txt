A long, long time ago there was a volcano
Living all alone in the middle of the sea
He sat high above his bay watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone, too.And from his lava came this song of hope
That he sang out loud everyday for years and years.I have a dreamI hope will come true
That you're here with me
and I'm here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up aboveWill send me someone to lava
Years of singing all alone
turned his lava into stone
Until he was on the brink of extinctionBut little did he know
That living in the sea below
Another volcano was listening to his song
Everyday she heard his tuneHer lava grew and grewBecause she believed his song was meant for her
Now she was so ready
To meet him above the sea
As he sang his song of hope for the last time
I have a dream
I hope will come trueThat you're here with meAnd I'm here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
Will send me someone to lavaRising from the sea belowStood a lovely volcano
Looking all around but she could not see him
He tried to sing to let her know
That she was not there alone
But with no lava, his song was all gone
He filled the sea with his tears
And watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her
I have a dream
I hope will come true
That you're here with me
And I'm here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava
Oh they were so happy to finally meet above the sea
All together now their lava grew and grew
No longer are they all alone, with Aloha as their new home
And when you visit them this is what they sing
I have a dream I hope will come true
That you'll grow old with me and I'll grow old with you We thank the earth, sea, the sky, we thank too
I lava you
I lava you
I lava you
