Can you call my lifeline cause I give up
And I raise my white flag can just give in
Cause I'm barely breathing, got no reason for grieving
That's just how I feel
I'm just trying to be realWish I can turn the switch on
Leave it on all damn day long
Get it tattooed on my arm just because they told me not to
Wish I could turn you all off
Say it without going soft
But we all know I'm not one to tell you you have got toShiver, feel it, take it, break it,
Make it what you wanna
Loose it, choose it, find it, mind it, bruise it,
Use it how you gonnaShiver, feel it, take it, break it,
Make it what you wanna
Loose it, choose it, find it, mind it, bruise it,
Use it how you gonnaCan you call my lifeline cause I give up
And I raise my white flag can just give in
Cause I'm barely breathing, got no reason for grieving
That's just how I feel
And I feel the pressure to be perfect forever
That's just how I feel
I'm just trying to be realOh Oh Oh Oh
I'm just trying to be real
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Yeah e Yeah eh eh
I'm just trying to be real
