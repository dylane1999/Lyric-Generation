Here I am
Once again
Feeling lost but now and thenI breathe it in
To let it goAnd you don't know where you are now
Or what it would come to
If only somebody could hear
When you figure out how
You're lost in the moment
You disappearYou don't have to be afraid
To put your dream in action
Your never gonna fade
You'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy
Just remember me
When it turns out rightCause you know that if your living
Your imagination
Tomorrow you'll
Be everybody's fascination
In my victory
Just remember me
When I make it shineReaching high
Feeling low
I'm holding on but letting go
I'd like to shine
I'll shine for you
And it's time to show the world how
It's a little bit closer
As long as I'm ready to go
All we have is right now
As long as you feel it inside you knowYou don't have to be afraid
To put your dream in action
Your never gonna fade
You'll be the main attractionNot a fantasy
Just remember me
When it turns out rightCause you know that if your living
Your imagination
Tomorrow you'll
Be everybody's fascination
In my victory
Just remember me
When I make it shineEvery one can tell you how
When it's all said and done
And harder times will change your mind
And make you want to run
But you want it
And you need it
Like you need to breathe the air
If they doubt you
Just believe it
That's enough to get you thereYou don't have to be afraid
To put your dream in action
Your never gonna fade
You'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy
Just remember me
When it turns out rightCause you know that if your living
Your imagination
Tomorrow you'll
Be everybody's fascinationIn my victory
Just remember me
When I make it shi-i-i-i-i-i-ine
