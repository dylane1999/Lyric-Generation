I get up around seven
Get out of bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothing, no
Because worrying's a waste of my time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

We've been dancing with Mister Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before

We've been dancing with Mister Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

Now, I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said the little better than before

We've been dancing with Mister Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone

Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I leave it allâ€“behind
Yowsa!
