You're sailing softly through the sun
in a broken stone age dawn.
You fly so high.I get a strange magic,
oh, what a strange magic,
oh, it's a strange magic.
Got a strange magic,
got a strange magic.You're walking meadows in my mind,
making waves across my time,
oh no, oh no.I get a strange magic,
oh, what a strange magic,
oh, it's a strange magic.
Got a strange magic,
got a strange magic.Oh, I'm never gonna be the same again,
now I've seen the way it's got to end,
sweet dream, sweet dream.Strange magic,
oh, what a strange magic,
oh, it's a strange magic.
Got a strange magic,
got a strange magic.It's magic, it's magic, it's magic.Strange magic,
oh, what a strange magic,
oh, it's a strange magic.
Got a strange magic.Strange magic STRANGE MAGIC
oh, what a strange magic STRANGE MAGIC
oh, it's a strange magic.
Got a strange magic.Strange magic STRANGE MAGIC
oh, what a strange magic STRANGE MAGIC
oh, it's a strange magic.
Got a strange magic,
got a strange magic,
you know I got a strange magic,
yeah, I got a strange magic,
oo-o-o-oo, strange magic. (fade)
