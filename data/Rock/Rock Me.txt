Sweet little baby, you don't have to go
Little baby, tell me you won't go
We'd be so good together if we had the time
'Cause being alone is a nowhere state of mind

Loving ain't no crime, oh no
I see your man ain't here, he don't care
The way of the night has gone and we'll move on
Got to find a way to face another day

I search the world for someone I'll never find
Someone who ain't the hurting kind
If you stay the night, oh yeah
We'll make the wrong seem right

So come on now and
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
We'll burn in love tonight

Sweet little baby, oh don't you go
You ain't so innocent, I know
I know your heart's like mine, oh yeah
And I will find the time to make you mine
And if your love goes bad, if it makes you sad
But I'll be back for more at your door

Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Before the morning light, we'll burn with love tonight
Burn with love tonight

And when your man don't care, I will be there
Still be loving real good love, so baby now
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, come on, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
There's no wrong or right we'll burn with love
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, come on, rock me, roll me through the night
Rock me, rock me, roll me through the night
There's nothing left to do but make sweet love to you
Come on and rock me
