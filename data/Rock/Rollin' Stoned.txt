Sipping down shouting about yeah we used to shake it out
Those days now I remember when anything was all right
Someone had my video blasting through the radio
Neighbours screaming out, "What the hell's going on here?"

We were already gone with a whole lot to go
When the police showed I told them, "Kiss my arse"
So young living to die and I was on my own
Two wrongs making a right I was rolling stoned

Rich is building houses Gary's doing hard time
Jamie's in the desert and Brently's bought a gun
I saw an old photograph all that I could do was laugh
And scratch my head in wonder where did all the days go?

We were already gone with nowhere to go oh no
I was singing my songs with a heart and soul
So young I was living to die I was rolling stoned
Two wrongs making a right I was rolling stoned

It's a wonder I'm alive can't believe I ever made it through that ride
Rocking all over the night I was rolling stoned
So young I was living to die I was rolling stoned
Two wrongs making a right I was rolling stoned
Damn good to be alive wonder how I ever managed to survive
Rocking all over the night I was rolling stoned
Stoned stoned stoned

Sipping down shouting about yeah we used to shake it out
Rich is building houses Gary's doing hard time
Brently bought a gun where did all the days go?
Rolling stoned I was rolling stoned
