Take me as you are
Push me off the road
The sadness, i need this time to be with you
I'm freezing in the sun
I'm burning in the rain
The silence, i'm screaming
Calling out your nameAnd i do, reside in your light
Put out the fire with me and find
Yeah, you'll lose the side of your circles
That's what i'll do
If we say goodbyeTo be is all i got to be
In all that i see
In all that i need this time
To me, the life you gave me
The day you said goodnight
The calmness in your faceThat i see through the night
The warmth of your light is pressing unto us
You didn't ask me why
I never would have known
Oblivion is falling down
And i do, reside in your light
Put out the fire with me and find
Yeah, you'll lose the side of your circles
That's what i'll do
If we say goodbye
To be is all i got to beIn all that i see
In all that i need this time
To me, the life you gave me
The day you said goodnight
If you could only know me
Like your prayers at nightThen everything between you and me
Will be all right
To be is all i got to be
In all that i seeIn all that i need this time
To me, the life you gave me
The day you said good... night...
She's already taken
She's already taken
She's already taken me
She's already taken
She's already taken me
The day you said goodnight...
