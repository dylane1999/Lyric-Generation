So what's the point in all of this?
When you will never change
The days have pass, The weather's changed
Should I be sorry? Could I be sorry?
I did it all, all for you
Hoping you would see
Your eyes are dull, your hands are clenchedAre we ready? Are we ready?
But you, you think about yourself
Only but yourself
But what about. .
Un-lonely nights
Romantic moments
The love, the love
What about them?
Throw it all away
You know me well, You know it's wrong
Then what is it you feel?
You hide behind those perfect smiles
It won't fool me, cause you already did
I did it all, all for you
Hoping you could see
Your eyes are dull, your hands are clenchedAre we ready? Are we ready?But you, you think about yourself
Only but yourself
But what about. .
Un-lonely nights
Romantic moments
The love, the love
What about them?
Throw it all away
The perfect dates
The sweetest kisses
The love, the love
What about them?
Throw it all away
So what's the point in all of this?
When you will never change
The days have pass, The weather's changed
Should I be sorry? Should I be sorry?
