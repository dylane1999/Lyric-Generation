And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.Wish You Were Here
(Waters, Gilmour)Radio announcer man: ( Beautiful! Nice! Nonsense!)
Radio announcer woman:
(- And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I'm with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it? )
Radio announcer man:
( I`m sure Of it!)Wish You Were Here.So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell,
Blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?And did they get you to trade
Your heros for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl,
Year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.
