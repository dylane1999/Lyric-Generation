Here I go out to sea again
The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the airGulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
You know it feels unfair
There's magic everywhereLook at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshineNo need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to hide and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful lifeSun's in your eyes the heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're thereAnd I need a friend, oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my ownLook at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshineNo need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to hide and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful lifeI need a friend, oh, I need friend
To make me happy
Not so aloneLook at me here
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshineNo need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to hide and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
Wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
