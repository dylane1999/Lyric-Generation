Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistakenBut you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are cryingIn your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e-e
What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e-e ohAnother mother's breaking heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistakenIt's the same old theme since 1916
In your head, in your head
Their still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are dyingIn your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e-e
What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e-e oh
